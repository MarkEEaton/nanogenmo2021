     asked Pris, anxiously. Ah, he was there, was he? It was awful! asked Amy.
asked Amy, pathetically. Can we do anything for you? Don't be alarmed! You are
angry. asked Amy, wonderingly. Amy? asked Amy, abruptly. Avast there! You cannot
assume the power of another. But it will only appear what it is. Don't attract
attention by standing here arguing. Another young autocrat! asked Dan anxiously.
Now, then--altogether! It's awful! Who will assassinate you? I am, assented
Dalzell, and I admit it. Why do you ask that? And don't ask Dan anything about
it. The annual examinations were approaching. they asked. We'll get along; we
always have. It is, she assented. Why shouldn't you aspire to it? she asked.

'count? You ain't been away from the mountains as I have. she asked. anxiously.
he asked abruptly. he asked with apparent carelessness. I--I always aimed to
tell you. she asked anxiously. Is he alive? You're always doing things to
attract attention to yourself. he asked. It's no more than buck-shot anyhow.
Alive. She was at that age. He approached her. I had to, she admitted. She's
asleep. she asked, although she knew. he asked. Allow me. And they were alone.
Di asked alertly. No address here. he asked. He admitted it. she asked. she
asked. he asked.
     Such was his acceptance. They stared at each other as across some abyss. I
want to be away--I will be away! You did it, she added. Is there anything to
this absurd tale? That your apology? he asked. she asked. You're a trump anyhow,
he affirmed. This was more--it assailed him, absorbed him. He further asks,
Where? But of April. Most astonishing! arrest him. Late in the afternoon we
advanced again. What about the alleged atrocities in Belgium? he was asked. He
did not abandon them then. To arms then, and still to arms! she asked. he
answered, with almost a shout. he answered. Not to-night, he answered. Will you
allow me to do so? It is always in that direction that the apparition appears.
he asked. she answered. she asked. I looked around me in astonishment. he asked,
in an agonized whisper.
     she asked; he seems to be angry with you. Are you angry with me? I
approached him. in my arms! in my arms! Late in the afternoon we advanced again.
What about the alleged atrocities in Belgium? he was asked. He did not abandon
them then. To arms then, and still to arms! I asked: Where are you from? What
answer will you make to this accusation? I accordingly went along with him. what
am I able to do? I asked them, 'Am I really alive?' the army of jinns is here
arrived. It is now, alas! Antistrophe I. Awake, O my feet, awake: Antistrophe.
Antistrophe I. Antistrophe. Aeschylus also Ag. Antistrophe I. Awake, O my feet,

Edwards! Ach, Milne-Edwards! Ay, marry, that will I, answered he.
     Then Ay! But alas for him! Ay, but we will! he asked, astonished. He had
no answer for this. he asked. What aboot them? I'll allow no such language aboot
her. What's ailin' you? You've had your answer both from her and me. he asked.
No, it ain't that. Arrange that among yoreselves. I'll ask you that. I ce'tainly

asked. he asked. He answered. Not anymore. That's all I ask. The red-coat
assented at once. Was this red-coat alone? For that he had an answer. he asked.
he asked. he asked. She did not answer. Already she had adjusted the snowshoes.
     He was not angry at her. She was afraid of it. she asked. he asked, almost
harshly. he asked in pretended alarm. she asked. She was alive to her finger-
tips. That's the answer. It ain't allowed by the Commissioner. That ain't much
to ask. I'll not argue with you. she asked. Will you accept? I'm ashamed of you!
Ah, they have received aid! the army and we too. But they were more American
then than they are now. He is from Acredale. Do you know a Mr. Atterbury in--in
your army? Atterbury--Atterbury--why, yes! she asked. All were apparently there.
Mrs. Atterbury asked. You are an abolitionist? Mrs. Atterbury asked. How absurd!
He waited, now in alert anticipation. They are making for Mrs. Atterbury's
apartment. he asks, in apparent haste. He is not alone.
     He--he--ah! I am ashamed of myself. Always affectionately. Of what am I
accused? Of what am I accused? 'Shall I ask him?' This he did not attempt to
answer. 'Nay, Sir, argument is argument. I will not allow of that.' Addisons

genial Andy. She did not answer. He ain't allowed in there. he asked. she asked.
she appealed. Is that agreeable? he asked. Is there anything more that I can do?
Then he added: It amounted to a shooting affair. He attacked me; it was self-
defense. Here's another thing: you ain't alone yourself.
     No, I shouldn't have asked that. You shouldn't ask that, agreed Donnegan.
She had not been carried away by his argument. he asked. Ah, I have it! He was
afraid. Aye, that's what I am. Anything I have is yours! Why, I'm arguing with
myself. You have that advantage. There ain't any argument. He blinked that
absurdity away. No, he was more apt to be the mainspring of their action. she
asked. Is there anyone here? But he allowed himself to be pushed away. he asked
angrily. No, I ain't. But he managed it with the same apelike adroitness. The

Augh! Artillery, too! he asked. Attention! Attention! What for ask? he asked.
Did you ask to be admitted to his prison? This is an affront to the art. she
answered. answered another, more in front. he asked them. she asked them. she
asked.
     he asked. I never had to ask anything of anybody before. she asked again
anxiously. I'm just afraid, that's all. she asked. She'll do anything for you.
And my foot's asleep already. And here's another! she asked. she asked. We're
afraid to stay here all alone. she answered. For, alas! and Age! ALESSANDRA and
CASTIGLIONE Alessandra. I will amend. abstractedly. astonished. Is there no

anomalies is over. There was no answer. It amazed him. Added to this was another
difficulty. he asked. asked the other. asked the other. Who asked him? So I
asked him.
     And he admitted it? That's why I ask. he asked. He added apologetically,
I'm so heavy. He ain't. Absolutely not! he asked. Where away? Will it be too
much to ask you to attend to this? Where away? he answered. Do they allow him
here? what arrangements? he asked. But the academy? Aisy, me frind; don't be
alarmed. She assented. What have you to ask? What is amiss? we are attacked! he
asked. He accompanied them. For awhile. No, she ain't. asked the other. he
asked. she asked. But artillery? You will find an abundance of ammunition for
your artillery. whom have they attacked?
     she answered. she asked. Who has arrived? he asked. Bushy-Tail was angry.
Alexander and his successors were city-builders, administrators. It appears so.
It appears so. You ask what is self-evident, answered Pyrrhus. But when it was
arranged in B.C. Here C. Trebonius had already arrived. Ascendency of Pericles

Ionian alphabet adopted at Athens. What, thou art an astrologer? Astronomy and
judicial astrology. Amator. He acts it. she asked. 'How absurd!' I was alarmed.

Augustine, Ariosto, and Arnold, and the long article on Athens, are among the
most striking and admirable papers in the volume. she asked. But weren't they in
Asia? I've been away off! Marjorie asked anxiously. No, not always. she asked.
As air-castles almost always do.
     asked Marjorie, alarmed. she asked. And the Arithmetic? and I answered
aloud, 'No, I don't.' she asked, angrily. I am all alone to-day, too, and I may
be alone to-night. Are you acquainted with me? I am not afraid to go away now.
But why did you ask? he asked. I don't believe it, he answered angrily. Because
you are so unreasonable; you will not answer me anything. I have answered you
now. Perhaps you will have another answer then. That is antiquated. she asked.
Not always. she asked. she asked, awed. she asked. he asked. I don't admire her
to-night, I'm afraid. O, Morris, don't be angry, don't be angry! Of course he
will, she answered in astonishment. asked Prue anxiously. But this was

the child-mother. Will you act upon my advice? That is all I ask. They will not
allow me there. he answered. Your position has always been assured. I admit
that. It is you to whom she is attached. He arrived to-night. what an anxiety!
     To--America--to-night! America! He did not ask her to do so. Are you
armed? Down with the aristocrats! he asked. she asked. she asked. Altogether too

right! asked Will. asked the other. Was it an accident? he asked. There was no

BRAVO

     Bless the boy! And what did the boy do about it? How beautiful it is!
under his breath. Got any boys to brag of? Phil Beaufort, you're a brick! A
brand snatched from the burnin'. Did you bring the gloves back? Bring him to me.
Bless me, what's that? The baron. You are not the baron? I am not to bear the
burden of his sins. It was very base. It is beautiful! His best lights--bah!
You've got him on your black books--that's all. Belle, there's something-- he
began. After that, we began to do better. So it's as bad as that, is it! Then:
Bump! Bully! And Is it blood that's on them? began Ben, proudly. A bust? It is a
bronze bust. The baby. Buckheath burst put boisterously. He's the boss of the
bosses down at Cottonville. Is it all back there?
     Do you believe that? I've brought those books for Johnnie. And I--and I
r'ared out on her for buyin' of 'em. The belle of the ball? That's what brought
me over here to-night. What's bringin' you here? he breathed. Who brought you?
Buckheath! I'll be back--. And there was the bankbook. How's the baby? You
bought it? Bobby blushed. Your brother! he bethought. I believe I'm your
husband's brother. Oh, bigger bites than that! Ina, too, became breezy, blithe.
It's his brother. What if I brought him up to-night? Bobby was there. she burst
out. Bobby! She banged the stove-griddle. About the bag. It was Bobby. Bobby!
Bobby! It's nothing to you that we have a brother who's a bigamist?
     But it's nobody's business but our business! My satchel's in the bakery--I
had my breakfast in the bakery. You brought her back! That's just what you did--
you brought her back. And who is BENT? A BOOT when it's on. A Boston Boy.
Boston: ROBERTS BROTHERS. What a blot on a view so beautiful! 'Call for a
barrage!' Where do you belong? We buried him and burned the aeroplane. It was
blood. But this was only a beginning. Back they wriggled breathlessly. After
Bishop Brent's benediction, a band concert was given. Don't bother me! 'Call for
a barrage!' Where do you belong? We buried him and burned the aeroplane. It was
blood. But this was only a beginning. Back they wriggled breathlessly. After
Bishop Brent's benediction, a band concert was given. Are you a blacksmith? It
beateth, blow on blow. And the house where my babes were born. My hands beat
your bed! It beateth, blow on blow. And the house where my babes were born.
     My hands beat your bed! Now, who bringeth this babe? Bear back! Bear back!
By the breath of my body! Now, by the breath of my body! 'Come down from out the
blossoms, bird! At 'em, Beauty! Down, Beauty! O the bloodsuckers! It is not so,
brother? Here is my breast. She was a good-looking breed. Did McRae bust our
barrels? An' we'll do just that, boss. Why didn't you bring her to me? That any
o' my business--or yours? Don't blame 'em a bit. It was burnt into her soul as
with a red-hot brand. Why, where's Barney? After the buffalo--what? All you
boys'll do just that. Your brother! Isn't this whiskey-smuggling bad business
all round? Just say it's bad business. Thinks it's bad business, does he? You
know your own business best. We don't buy from them. He bowed. If we buy, it'll
have to be now.
     You've no business here. You're a breed. Not a bit. He'll bluff it
through. he bellowed. I'm boss. He's in that business. You bet yore boots. Nor
did he bully or browbeat. Why had he brought her here? What'll we do if--if
there's a blizzard? No bed. We'd better hurry on, Beresford and I. And I'll open
it before you break through and bring it with you. He begged for both. Beresford
was breaking trail. Bring him in. Only that he had brought back the truth. In
business? He bowed again. You will break down. Have what, Barney, me b'y? The
battle was to begin that very day. Where you bound for? Where is Burnside? Is
the battle over? I'm blamed if I will! 'Bartow's brigade, stone bridge. But who
buys them about here? How besotted I am!
     That's bad. There's the bugle for boots and saddles now. Are all the boats
here? What a blarney you are! he breathes. He is not over his wound, and besides
he's but a boy. What's to become of you? More--more--I'm burning--more! How
beautiful it was! He breathed so softly, or did he breathe at all? It is better
for me to see Mr. Boone. We brought him here. That's better. You--do--not
believe that your brother is dead? I do believe you will do better than I
should. The boys? Now you believe me no heart and badness? The bad blood of the
Boones was all up in her soul now. But I am afraid there is more blood than
brains. To MR. BARRY. 'To DR. BROCKLESBY. Burney.' I was very bad. Burney.' But
how did she bear this? But my business is with myself.' There they breakfasted.
Busted. What about the birthmark? What'll you have, bud?
     Now they were out for blood. The blockheads! Besides, I'm beginning to
hope! Not bad at all. And who began it, then? I am very base. It was bluff. And
what was I beside him? Brave, but such a boy. I have to bring him back. Don't
bring it back. Did he-- Did he bluff me out? He bowed to her. You're my brother.
Beware of it. He began to build the packs. He's my brother! Busted. What about
the birthmark? What'll you have, bud? Now they were out for blood. The
blockheads! Besides, I'm beginning to hope! Not bad at all. And who began it,
then? I am very base. It was bluff. And what was I beside him? Brave, but such a
boy. I have to bring him back.

my brother. Beware of it. He began to build the packs. He's my brother! You
bought it? Bobby blushed. Your brother! he bethought. I believe I'm your
husband's brother. Oh, bigger bites than that! Ina, too, became breezy, blithe.
It's his brother. What if I brought him up to-night? Bobby was there. she burst
out. Bobby! She banged the stove-griddle. About the bag. It was Bobby. Bobby!
Bobby! It's nothing to you that we have a brother who's a bigamist? But it's
nobody's business but our business! My satchel's in the bakery--I had my
breakfast in the bakery. You brought her back! That's just what you did--you
brought her back. If I do, burn me!
     Battle! Not for Bob, Beulah. My son was in this bloody battle, then! It is
very beautiful! He will never betray you, Bob. There's bowels in the man's body!
You must bring him down, Blodget. What do you think you're doing, Billie
Bradley? Is he bashful? cried Billie breathlessly. breathed Billie. breathed
Billie again. Is th-that all, Billie? What is it, Billie? I thought I'd brought
you up better. There's the bed! But who will buy it? The beginnings will be
difficult, as they have been in the Balkans. how it tells Of the rapture that
impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells, bells, bells, Of the bells,
bells, bells, bells, Bells, bells, bells-- To the rhyming and the chiming of the
bells! Oh, the bells, bells, bells! The bells!--ah the bells! The bells!--ah,
the bells! There, ma'am, 's the book. If such there be, my friend Baldazzar
here-- Baldazzar! Had she a brother? Leave the book behind! He bowed. That so,
boys? Where we can do that business. Beat me?
     You're on for the bet? The boy blinked. But--what's this, Bull? He--he's
beaten me once. And that's why you brought him? Just back up, if you don't mind,
Bull. What boat is that? A British man-of-war. Down with the bloody backs! What
is your business? The battle at once became general. By the board! A banshee,
begorra! When was it broken off? Now, will you believe it? Now, will you believe
it? Then, will you believe it? Now, will you believe it? Now, will you believe
it? bound! But Bunny Boy was too quick for him. What a beautiful bear! Then he
began to behave very strangely. The battle was obstinate and bloody. But she was
not to be so baffled. Back, back! But the cannon-shots bewildered them all. To
such observance of it I was born and bred. That's in the Bible. I'll do the best
I can.
     I believed in him. Have you brought her picture back? Isn't that in the
Bible? You call me brave; she was brave. A world-without-end bargain. No, he
burst out. Aren't you bright? Is he your brother? I don't believe I know what
beauty is. I don't believe you will. I am bright. But she is better. Morris was
my twin-brother; he was my blessing; he is my blessing. My baby, my poor baby!

     I have a box for the 'Huguenots.' Englishmen bow badly. Will you have a
biscuit? You are better in the cart-shed than here. It brought back so much. It
was betrayed. He is a beast. It is no business of ours. We were better off
before. Can you not believe me? It is not as bad as that. He had had much to

not now. We can beat them back if we like. No, you are better out of it. I have

the blazes they're doing it for, he broke out. Besides, their backs were towards
me. Beaumaroy raised his brows. Or with Mr. Beaumaroy's? He was to scatter it--

business. No business of his! She's back! At Bogota, isn't it? Boys from
Centerville, too, but a tough-lookin' bunch. Back again, boys? How about Bluff--
where is he? Is Bluff there? Beat it, Bluff. exclaimed Bluff, bending over. I'm
no butcher. I don't bother about a little blow. It will be easy, boys, believe
me. Now, what's all this row about your black box, Will? Here they are, boys!
Bluff has killed his bear! He is my brother. His brother? The body--is it here?
It is an ominous beginning of their betrothal. You believe that?


CHARLIE

     Here was a catastrophe! A carriage for me? Of course he isn't! You will
have to, for I'm not coming. Isn't that charming? He was close to you. That's
capital! How could he do it? But why all this concealment? was the command of
both. Why, how you have changed! And so of other and more complex cases. Could
we? That's a capitalistic crowd. Who's the captain here? But, of course, he
couldn't ask. Of course they hadn't. Clack! Which did they call you? What's the
cruise? Crabtown. he called cheerily. And did you come through the course
easily? With that the chums had to be content. Cut it! he called. No; of course
not. It came. How did it come out? chuckled the officer in charge.
     To be continued. Continued. To be continued. Call up to your mind what I
was, and what my circumstances were. I was at college. Who cares? she cried. To
be continued. It is not very clear to himself. I can't. they all cried. Ma and
the children have to be taken care of. she cried in a contrite voice. Why, it's
curly! Of course he was not. she called through the casement. Come in. Come in.
Why, Johnnie Consadine she cried. I've--Cassy. How does she come to be here with
a cap and apron on to-night? she called to him. Come here. Come, come, Lyd. You
can't come into Cottonville without crossing a stream. He wasn't crazy when he
come to the house. she cried. she cried out. She decided on a conservative
course. Culp's.
     Wonder could we catch up with them? The cabin came in sight. she cried.
The car! she cried. They're coming--they're coming. cried Beulah Catlett. We'll
have a truck-patch there, and a couple of cows and some chickens, she said. I
came on this here. It's company. Is he coming? When was he coming and what was
he coming for? You could construct the rest of him. he cried. she cried. He
called it croquette. Crops could not touch ours. To the city? Not cheff. You
too, certainly. Certainly. Certainly I have it. she cried. Cornish came to
supper. cried Cornish. Conceivably. So of course I came home. cried Cornish.
She'll catch it! The conductor looked curiously at her.
     she cried. The cat's out. she cried. You'll catch it--you'll catch it! he
cried. Did Mr. Cornish come to see you? she cried. Come in there--come. Cornish!
You're completely out of it. I don't care why! I can't do that. he cried.
Cornish cried, and he kissed her. she cried. Of course you can't have my
daughter now. Out in the Cold. No cold Can chill its ardor! Consequently, it got
into court. Cutting. S. S. Cox. Chicago. What did he care? I come from Kansas,
where we have cyclones. The calamitous conflict is not of my seeking. Then came
the crowning stroke. 'How could we? We had few casualties.' how cool I was. I
cried.
     Only consider! This is her card. Certainly not. Will you come with me?
Certainly! In consequence we had a cheerful evening. Can I come in? He will not
come with me. The Council! he cried. I checked myself. he cried. Are you coming?
Come here, you. she cried. Curse him! Of what do they consist? How could his
portrait have come here? He is, then, a captain? I come from Kansas, where we
have cyclones. The calamitous conflict is not of my seeking. Then came the
crowning stroke. 'How could we? All are concealed. We had few casualties.' how
cool I was. I cried. Only consider! I crept up in the corner and hid myself. Why
have you come here?
     All who came near were captured. All was changed. I began to have them
constantly in my company. Has the frog then caught cold? what do people call
this conduct? call him. Up into the chambers where She croucheth! Ah, change on
change! Up into the chambers where She croucheth! Ah, change on change! Now he
cometh to the church door. cried he. he cried. Crick! Crack! Come with me
straightway to my castle. cried he. cried he. cried he. cried he. Come! cried
he. cried he. she cried. And he's no child. That was certain. Where's his camp?
Her pride and courage collapsed. Come clean, McRae. This is a God-fearin' camp.
     The Crees were close to their quarry. They can't catch us. They'll come to
our camp an' raise Cain. Can't do that. Cattle. The constable answered the call.
Coming up creek. The constable counted noses. Count me out. He had it coming to
him. What church you been j'inin', C.N.? The fur-trader chewed his cud
imperturbably. Me, I'd gun you both for a copper cent. Morse & Company
considered. That's where you come in. she cried. Play all your cards close. I
caught her. on that case? She cried out. she cried. Curse him! She was as a
child to him. We can't help what's coming. She at Jasper's cabin on Cache Creek.
He called to her. He's coming. In a cabin on Bull Creek. No chance of that. You
did come, then?
     My conscience is clear, anyhow. Crunch-- crunch--crunch. Can't be that.
We'll come up with them to-morrow. I was changin' it. Since then--well, you
couldn't call him a cheerful traveling companion, could you? What could he do?
Thinking could not change the conditions. I'll freeze here, the convict
complained. His eyes challenged hers coolly. Of course you will too. He's
promised a captain's commission. Was this a challenge? But you couldn't be in
the company in any event. Who's in command here? Then there is a calm. And how
came you off here? He is captain of Company K of the Caribee Regiment-- Caribee?
Do they have care? That's why you've come to console the afflicted? Carcassonne
--what's that? No; Carcassonne was a city of the South. Of course I can. When
did you come? Of course I have. Who commands it? Come here. you have been
converted? Of course you will! The coast was clear.
     he called. Why aren't you with your company? I have the countersign. Now
make all the clatter you can after I challenge. Who comes there? Come. Why, this
can't be the creek! This was some comfort. He is no coward. Where can it come
from? Here there was companionship. Courage, my boy, courage! Come on. Close up,
there! But how could they carry the prisoners with them? Where does that come
from? What could he do? Jack crept to the corner. You came to me for comfort. He
needs comfort and counsel. Are they Copperheads? Are they Copperheads? Is this a
Copperhead community? Who of the Caribees can these be? But, my child. if he had
but confided to her! But they could not. She could get no further clew. Do come
to me, or let me come to you. Who could it be?
     Will you call a carriage? Who came with me? I came into the court by the
merest chance. I should, of course, obey you if you commanded me. Who is here--
who is come? Of course I should. Certainly. What is the charge against me? The
court--the charges against Jack! Certainly not. where could she catch small-pox?
Chambers. Such was my candour.' Why was he not in such circumstances as to keep
his coach? Why should he complain? The physicians consider me as cured. 'To MRS.

     In Campbell's Chancellors ed. Croker's Corres. Confound him! Come clean.
Me croak him? Why should I croak him? he complained. Where d'you come from? Then
how do you come here? A case of curiosity, commented the colonel. It has been a
pleasant chat, colonel. Is that clear? Is it clear? The colonel writhed in his
chair. That clear? Above all, what the colonel was thinking and doing and if the
colonel himself had come. That is, if he could. I can't do it. I can't have it.
And then at last came the call. It was more commodious than most of the shacks
of The Corner. It should only begin to cream through the crust. There he comes!
Not in The Corner. Have you come here, she cried, for--for Donnegan? What crew?
she cried. she cried. I've come for you! You see that clock in the corner?
     And when it's eleven o'clock the clock will chime. Confound you! he
called. No, they will change. she cried at him. Not that The Corner was peopled
with cowards. There was no competition. Of course, I can't. What could I do?
What could I do? The clock, and all that claptrap. He didn't crumble. In that
case, of course, I shouldn't care at all. How can you carry him? He had a
confederate. But I'm clever, too. I don't care what you do about that. He came
up just to clear the way. he cried. I am the cripple! Can you control her? It
can't be! she cried. What could she do? And now, curse them, I'll do theirs! Of
course I went out cold. Don't come back until I call for you. A child could
comprehend it. I can't. she was crying.
     Confound him! Come clean. Me croak him? Why should I croak him? he
complained. Where d'you come from? Then how do you come here? A case of

coming and what was he coming for?
     You could construct the rest of him. he cried. she cried. He called it

certainly. Certainly. Certainly I have it. she cried. Cornish came to supper.

don't care why! I can't do that.
     he cried. Cornish cried, and he kissed her. she cried. Chapter I. What of
my cousin? demanded the captain, calmly. inquired the chaplain, with curiosity.
Has he no claims? The captain used to call her his clarion. Do you consider that
so certain, sir? As for me, I count for nothing, of course. Can't see, when he
don't come. Nick close by; count him. Such critturs be beyond calcilation!
Certainty not. Come in. Cap'in pale-face chief. Come in court, too, when he
want. How could you be certain of this? Coxe. Coxe. What cap'in come for? Coxe.
he cried. You can't catch me! You can't catch me! he cried. What was that you
called me? And cornbread! Oh, Chet, do be careful!
     Oh, come on, he cried. Come on! A homestead at Cherry Corners! fairly
crowed Chet. Why do they call it 'Cherry Corners?' And for Chet too! Why you
came? At Cherry Corners? cried Chet sarcastically. What'll we do with him, Chet?
Come on, cried Billie again. There now, be careful, will you? Have you girls cut
the cake? With a canopy over it! H-here it comes! It's coming closer! Here it
comes! Here it comes! Caved in! And they had clubs. the girls cried in chorus.
Chet, what is it? But how did you catch it? she cried. Of course, came from
Teddy. Count 'em, cried Chet. We can't come down, you know. Comp. Californie!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
     Come! I was not conscious of it. Cousin! it comes again! 'Tis he--he comes
himself! In such a cause I am the veriest coward. His judgment consequently is
too correct. Come! Come here! Carry me in! Color was pulsing in her cheeks. The
other was very calm. Then he come on in. What a chance for a crafty mind! How
could he convict the sheriff? And what's all the celebration about? Into a
chair. How come he shot at a chair? So you cleaned up the sheriff with a chair?
I couldn't myself. How come? Choke him down! he commanded. What comes of it?
Then he continued. You may charge your own commission. The compensation of
collectors depends on you Congress and not on me. cried the captain. They are
too close. Captain Conkerall was delighted.
     Come in! he cried. Certainly I have, and now I will be branded as a
coward. Some were laughing and chatting, others canvassing the case of the
culprits. cried the brutal captain. cried the captain as the boatswain's-mate
halted. cried Captain Snipes. he cried. Calhoun. Certainly. Not a cent. he
cried. Then charge! I've commenced. Cockburn caught him and called for
assistance. Is he in command? Come down--come down from this certain death! he
cried. cried Captain Lane. They're comin' on their all-fours! Come down, Sukey,
come down! Why are you cheering? When is what to come off? She came on the
stroke of the clock. Come, sir, why don't you cry any more? Of course we have a
merry-go-round. he cried. They replied, Because you come against our country.
Such is the case. Certainly.
     He further contemplated to cut through the Isthmus of Corinth. She now
came to meet him in Cilicia. Before the close of B.C. The Belgae conquered by
Caesar. The calendar is reformed by Caesar. Among her effects at the convent
there was found a confession, and a complete catalogue of all her crimes, in her
own hand-writing. Concluded. There are no contradictions in it. she cried out.
He cannot cheat them. M-M-Milton, it's close on to S-Sabba'day. When did he
come? To be continued. Of course it was not. She carelessly assured them of her
clemency. They control the sentiments of the 'better class.' Condescend to him!
I am a cipher. He is coming to her. Come, and gone, and coming. It has come in
dream-land. Come with me. To be continued. In the church? It comes. I can't.
Now, are you comfortable? She's a Christian, too. Of course I will. Couldn't I?
     Can't you speak, child? Where were you, child. No, about herself, because
she isn't a Christian. The coat or the cheese or the pipe. Why didn't you come
before? You know when the Crucifixion was, of course? called out the Captain.
Where did he come from? But you are comforted. Christ could do it, and he did do
it, but can you? I closed it, I could read no more. How many could I count? Do
you find the cottage so charming? To California. Not at you, to you, she
corrected. Have you had any comfort to-day? What could I do with her? But she
could not do that. It certainly is. You cannot change for the better, so why
should you change at all? And Mother Carey's chickens? I couldn't. Do cry,
child. He is comforted for it now. She will comfort you. What has changed you?
There were, many such in that country churchyard. How could you? How could you?
Why, child!
     In the church? It comes. I can't. Now, are you comfortable? She's a
Christian, too. Of course I will. Couldn't I? Can't you speak, child? Where were
you, child. No, about herself, because she isn't a Christian. The coat or the
cheese or the pipe. Why didn't you come before? You know when the Crucifixion
was, of course? called out the Captain. Where did he come from? But you are
comforted. Christ could do it, and he did do it, but can you? I closed it, I

To California. Not at you, to you, she corrected. Have you had any comfort to-
day? What could I do with her? But she could not do that. It certainly is. You
cannot change for the better, so why should you change at all? And Mother
Carey's chickens? I couldn't. Do cry, child.
     He is comforted for it now. She will comfort you. What has changed you?
There were, many such in that country churchyard. How could you? How could you?
Why, child! she cried. Certainly not. There is cholera again. When can you come?
You will come with me? Then it is for the castle. Curse him--curse him! The
cholera has come, Excellency. Come, don't sit crying. Certainly not. I will
come. he cried. But what was Catrina to do? Will you come to the castle?
Certainly. The countess herself in nowise contradicted this conclusion. The
countess cackled and pointed to a chair. I came for yours, countess. he
continued. How could she? I was just coming to that. I couldn't do that! I
couldn't.
     No, of course not. He is so d--d clever! Come in! Come in and close the
door. There are complications. How curious! On the other counts I leave him to
his own conscience. They will come to-day. That I am convinced of. There is only
the countess. More is coming. I choked him. No; by her circumstances. On the
contrary. The countess was charmed--and showed it. corrected Catrina. Why did
you come here? cried the countess. She was not careful. Catrina had come too
near. You are her cousin? Then suddenly she changed the conversation. His only
craft was forest craft. Then why do you come? So there are changes coming, are
there? Is the change coming soon? It was very cold. This country, he continued,
is unsettled. Come in, come in! he cried.
     Choose now. Choose now! she cried. It was coming. It was coming. It was
coming. Come in! she cried. It is your only chance. The countess collapsed into
a soft chair. she cried. That is why I came for you. He had been through the
Commune. It is our only chance. she cried. Certainly not. There is cholera
again. When can you come? You will come with me? Then it is for the castle.
Curse him--curse him! The cholera has come, Excellency. Come, don't sit crying.
Certainly not. he cried. But what was Catrina to do? Will you come to the
castle? Certainly. The countess herself in nowise contradicted this conclusion.
The countess cackled and pointed to a chair.
     I came for yours, countess. he continued. How could she? I was just coming

     So there are changes coming, are there? Is the change coming soon? It was

Choose now. Choose now! she cried. Have you a cloak? It was coming. It was
coming. It was coming. Come in! she cried. It is your only chance. The countess
collapsed into a soft chair. she cried. That is why I came for you. He had been
through the Commune. It is our only chance. Corporal C.W. Clayton. Chaytor,

Ciceronian. of Cic. to Cic. Then there came the beginning of the change. he
chuckled. she commanded. Charge, Pedro--charge! They were in camp. he called. he
called again. Now they were crumpling down! But he had the club! he called. she
cried. To-night it was clear.
     It was his cry--the wolf-cry. Then he came on. To him it was the club.
Come, boy--come! Come! she cried. she cried. he panted, clutching his chest.
Each night she was calling earlier, and coming closer to the camp. she cried. I
don't care about that. he cried. He was intent on the cabin--only the cabin. It
was the creek. But there was no chance now. he cried. he commanded. The club was
washed clean. And then the change came. she commanded. Charlevoy! cherchons!.
And so Tom Chist he was called and Tom Chist he was christened. Where d'ye come
from? cried Tom Chist. cried the Colonel. cried Captain Obadiah. Come. he cried.
And so Tom Chist he was called and Tom Chist he was christened.
     Where d'ye come from? cried Tom Chist. cried the Colonel. cried Captain
Obadiah. Come. he cried. And then it all came out! Tower Cottage, that's called.
Come in! The Captain was not there; he was at her own house, with Cynthia. It
was complete surrender as to the combination knife-and-fork. They had come
opposite the cottage now. All quiet at the Cottage as you came by? Come in. Come
with me! In any case I don't care much. she cried. How came he up there? It was
no care to him now! cried Cynthia, surprised. Can't be! No you come and help, if
I cry out! Is the car coming for you, Mr. You're confusing me with Captain
Cranster! I'm not a child, like Cynthia. the camp is ours! We've come to convoy
the wagon in. Say, be careful with that contraption, will you? Crash! There he
comes!
     Count me in, called Will. called out Will. He never counts the cost.
complained Will. Come on, an' we'll do him up! Crash! continued Will, stroking
the cat. called Frank, cheerily. It was criminal, that's what. Why, certainly.
It came again. That's just what has happened, and I've been chasing him all over
the country. Meanwhile I'll be creeping closer all the while. Of course he did
just that? Where was Will with his camera then? Why, they ain't in the same
class as our chum here. It's some closer than our camp. Why, of course not. A
fellow can't climb out. How could they be when I kerried 'em carefully. Come on,
you fellows, cried Will. me for the comforts of our own camp. Of course he has.
Cheek, I call it. One of their own class he certainly was not. Not come in? You
will come with me? Certainly. No; he came with a purpose, that's certain. How
did it come there?


DELTA

     She isn't dear! what have you done to yourself now? Are you troubled with
dyspepsy, dear? Not a doubt on't, my dear. The deuce it is! The deuce you are!
Devilish little of that about me or any of my doin's. I don't deserve her, but I
will. Now, I'm disappointed. Who the deuce is it, then? It is the same,
doubtless. And the duel? Do not deny me this. Desperately, and she? It is
distorted or defective vision. Can you do it, Doctor? he demanded defiantly.
That's because you're Dave Darrin. Dave and Dan were ready. Then Dave ducked,
darted, dodged and wheeled about. directed Dan, grinning. Dave Darrin called up.
Do you understand that, Mr. David Darrin? she demanded. sighed Dan Dalzell
dismally. Now, drop that! demanded Dan, in a rage. Then is Dan? declared
Midshipman Darrin devoutly. ejaculated Dan in disgust.
     declared Dan Dalzell hotly. Always at a dance he danced with her more than
once. If Mrs. Meade deplored this, Dave Darrin did not. Of Mr. Darrin's? That's
ship-shape, Doctor! No, I a'n't, Doctor! They descend! And what the deuse is
that? It is due to the composer that this should be done. It was doing or dying,
with him. And she was not disappointed. I confess I am deeply disappointed in
you. That blouse is a dream--it's a dream. There--why, there's our dance! Then
you'll dance it with me? Is he a doctor? What have I done now? What of your own
development? It's Deanie. she demanded. The desolation and decay of a deserted
house was over all. I have dreamed about you here in the dark. I doubt not
Providence demands it of me. Dear me, said Mr. Deacon. Di was not there. She
described it. This was debauchery. Di was not there. To dance before him. Dwight
darling, are you sure there's no danger?
     Dwight demanded. Dwight demanded irritably. Why, Dwight! With Di and all!
What has she done? But now Dwight said: Daughter! You have it, haven't you,
Dwight? Dwight! Dwight Deacon, the dentist. from Dwight. Dwight! he demanded.
Dwight! What if it was Di? he divined. And how should she deal? she demanded.
She was at a disadvantage. It's Di. Why, don't the disgrace-- What disgrace?
That's the reason I done what I done. They dismissed it. Di was not there.

he was dead. Not death; not death! My heart with dread is dying! Doom raceth
against doom. What was the device? Not death; not death! My heart with dread is
dying! Doom raceth against doom. What was the device? What you doin' here? he
demanded. They were to be disappointed.
     What's doin'? Done what? Why had he done it? No doubt about that. You're
discharged. Different now. What's doin'? Will you dance with me? He had done
only his duty as he saw it. she demanded. How done for? But he had never
disciplined his desires. He dared not. That's the difference. I'm done, she told
him drearily. Where you at, Dawn? She demurred. Each of them dreaded snow-
blindness. At daybreak they were up. After all I done for him too. He dared not.
What was to be done then? he demanded. There were about a dozen in all. The deer
dropped in its tracks. Dress on me. He is again disappointed. Our dead are not
here. Why, how delightful! The devil he is!
     Dick grinned deprecating. Now, is it or is it not dishonorable for me to
do it? Here's an oasis in the desert of darkness. Is Davis here? It was
deserted. now, now there was no doubt. If I'm not drunk or dreaming, that's my
own Jack. No--the devil!--it is Pizarro--dead! What has been done with him? I
should only be a drag on you. I am disappointed in you, Dick. Dick casts about
despairingly. Was--I dreaming? Dick was with him. She had driven him to his
death. Poor dears, they are in dreadful distress. The doctor's with her now. All
that can be done has been done by his friends. It's no more dangerous for me
than for you. They have discovered the wrong done me? Why am I dishonored? What
has the Duke of Devonshire? and then he died.' 'Do you know the Duke and Duchess
of Devonshire? Only dirt, or wet or dry. My father was deeply depressed. Mrs.
Davis asked how the Doctor was. What can be done?' D'Arblay's Diary. Who's
Donnegan?
     'Then, he's in Dutch. After all what was Donnegan to him? For what was
darkness to this devil, Donnegan. It was Rusty Dick; and he's dead! What the
devil can I do? They drank. And who's Donnegan? Donnegan is--Donnegan, he
explained. That's Donnegan. Who's Donnegan? What have you done, what have you
done? What have you done? She had not deceived him. What the devil! What's the
difference? What have I done? He's different. What are you driving at? And why
dangerous? It was not a disguise. What the devil is in you? He was a devil. Do
you doubt that? Donnegan, by this time, was dead. she demanded. I dunno how he
does it. Donnegan will be there. And no doubt he could have done so. How should
it be done? And as for Donnegan?
     What was Donnegan to him? Once more she was dumb. Not for herself, but for
Donnegan. It's Donnegan again--Donnegan still? He's a dead one, and you've done
it! Who's Donnegan? 'Then, he's in Dutch. After all what was Donnegan to him?
For what was darkness to this devil, Donnegan. It was Rusty Dick; and he's dead!
What the devil can I do? They drank. And who's Donnegan? Donnegan is--Donnegan,
he explained. That's Donnegan. Who's Donnegan? What have you done, what have you
done? What have you done? She had not deceived him. What the devil! What's the
difference? He is not dead. What have I done? He's different. What are you
driving at? And why dangerous? It was not a disguise. What the devil is in you?
He was a devil. Do you doubt that?
     Donnegan, by this time, was dead. she demanded. I dunno how he does it.
Donnegan will be there. And no doubt he could have done so. How should it be
done? And as for Donnegan? What was Donnegan to him? Once more she was dumb. Not
for herself, but for Donnegan. It's Donnegan again--Donnegan still? He's a dead
one, and you've done it! There's no danger. Dear me, said Mr. Deacon. Di was not
there. She described it. This was debauchery. Di was not there. To dance before
him. Dwight darling, are you sure there's no danger? Dwight demanded. Dwight
demanded irritably. Why, Dwight! With Di and all! What has she done? But now
Dwight said: Daughter! You have it, haven't you, Dwight? Dwight! Dwight Deacon,
the dentist. from Dwight.
     Dwight! Dwight! What if it was Di? Where's Di? he divined. Not for
dollars. And how should she deal? she demanded. She was at a disadvantage. It's
Di. Why, don't the disgrace-- What disgrace? That's the reason I done what I
done. They dismissed it. Di was not there. Dwight! Dwight! What of dat? Has he
disinherited his daughter as he threatened? Can that be done? Dirty, too? T'ink
every day of dat. The deuce it is! The devil! What you t'ink he do dat for? What
have I done? Dearest--dearest mother! Red-man not'in' to do, dere. This is a
coup-d'-oeil not to be despised. 'Avenge his death!' The devil they have!
     What is it, dear? Was she, Dad? Debbie, you're a darling and I love you!
We can do all that to-morrow when we have daylight. There isn't any doubt about
that. Now what have I done? and Desolation! I will drop them. She died. Then I
but dreamed. Death! Dust had returned to dust. Dreams are no more. He was
through about dusk. Before dawn he was up and out again. There was no doubt
about it. You done that? That's Diablo. And what the devil difference does that
make to you? It has to be done. Who the devil are you? What the divil's the
difference? Has he a daughter? By the duel. They are now dead. 'Tis dreadful! he
demanded. He went downstairs and out of doors. This long-continued depreciation
was of early date. But here, too, they were disappointed.
     Definition of dreams. Who had departed? There were no debts. Why, what has
he done? This is what he has done. Who the Devil are you? Doubtless no. Were you
at the door when the Duke entered? What have I done? A distinction without a
difference. But to this duke. We are told that discussion is dangerous.
Dangerous to what? Not every day; I do some days. What has she done now? There,
there, deary! It has not been difficult. Deary me! I am disappointed in myself.
They are so different. No, it is too dry for me. You won't dare, some day. I
have not decided, dear. It is, dear. There's Deborah. There were no debts. Will
it make any difference to you--my decision? Not every day; I do some days. What
has she done now? There, there, deary!
     It has not been difficult. Deary me! I am disappointed in myself. They are
so different. No, it is too dry for me. I have not decided, dear. It is, dear.
There's Deborah. There were no debts. Will it make any difference to you--my
decision? And now it is all done. What have I done? But now he was at a
disadvantage. Will you dine here? And the doctor? I have no doubt of it. For me
it is different. But here, how different! those were days! Why with deference to
me? This is the door. What is this door? There is a difference. What difference?
It will be difficult. But he had other diseases more or less developed. You have
had diphtheria. It is not to drink. He is dead! But it was dangerous.
     No, it is different for me. I too have had my difficulties. They distrust
me. He is not dead; that is all. He dragged him to the fire-place. What is to be
done? There was only the door now between her and--what? What have I done? The
day passed as such days do. The new-comers were the most dangerous. And now it
is all done. What have I done? But now he was at a disadvantage. Will you dine
here? And the doctor? I have no doubt of it. For me it is different. But here,
how different! those were days! Why with deference to me? This is the door. What
is this door? There is a difference. What difference? It will be difficult. But
he had other diseases more or less developed. You have had diphtheria. It is not
to drink. But it was dangerous. No, it is different for me.
     I too have had my difficulties. They distrust me. He is not dead; that is
all. He dragged him to the fire-place. What is to be done? There was only the
door now between her and--what? What have I done? The day passed as such days
do. The new-comers were the most dangerous. It was decided to double the track.
That is very doubtful. Col. Davis. It was decided to double the track. That is
very doubtful. Col. Davis. The deed was done!!! I don't dare do that. McCready
drank again, out in the darkness. It was deadly now. I have had dogs do that. He
was three-quarters dog, and the dog-part of him demanded companionship. It's a
dog! He was a dog. And they were dogs. It was different. It was on this day that
she made a discovery. The door again! What of your doings? Was that dishonesty,
or only a pardonable diplomacy? Why the devil not?

     Excellently. Can you eat? Eat! This experience constantly evinces. You're
quick enough, too, when you exert yourself. Edgerton. But this wasn't to be the
end of my v'yagin'. Encroacher! So be at ease! Enchantress! What is the
explanation? she echoed. You'll have to excuse me. she exclaimed. she exclaimed.
It was after eleven o'clock. she echoed. she entreated him. She was expecting
Gray that evening. Early, darling, early! She was enjoying it. It was not
enough. If everything is over between you, why should you? Isn't everybody?
Especially Mrs. Bett was at ease. What on earth did you do it for? They
explained it again. But then they are the exceptions. in ecstasy. There are
other examples.

Euripides. Enough of that. Is it even so? That's enough for me. Isn't that
enough? she exploded. What's eatin' you? He was embarrassed. You're here, eh?
No, I've had enough. What's eatin' you? This was not easy. She blamed herself
for escaping at his expense. Weren't you expectin' me? What else can he do?
Earned it, didn't you? What on earth are they all doing here? Everybody embraced
everybody else. This evening. he exclaimed with enthusiasm.

exclaimed Jones, excitedly. Eh--who is it? Eat! What is there to eat? More than
evasive. It's simple enough--a home-made epigram. He expected her. There is some
extraordinary error in all this. It is some error which can be explained. 'Its
elegance who can exhibit? Every sentence is an essay.' Is not this enough for
you? Macaulay's Essays, ed. Macaulay's Essays, ed. I had some expostulations

Explain yourself. That is not enough. for in my examination I overlooked it
entirely. Enough!
     But they existed, all the same. he exclaimed. No; this is earnest. That's
easy enough! she evaded. I have enough. But have you enough of this? What--for
example? Isn't that enough? She is not educated. she exclaimed, as his eyes
looked into hers. He is enthusiastic. What else should I do? Everything! Did you
expect it? They had educated each other. But they existed, all the same. he
exclaimed. No; this is earnest. That's easy enough! she evaded. I have enough.
But have you enough of this? What--for example? Isn't that enough? She is not

enquired. And now he is exiled. Etta excused him readily enough. It was easy
enough, of course. he enquired. Even Etta was affected by it. It is all I
expected and more. Then I will not examine it. She was easier game than Etta.
Etta's eyes gleamed with excitement. Where is Etta? the elder lady exclaimed.
Etta's eyes dilated. For the Emperor too. Her courage and energy were not
exhausted. It was enterprising. In her drawing-room, Excellency. And this was
the end of all! Only on the estate? I should evacuate. But why, Excellency?
Equality!

exhausted. Not a sound escaped her ears. Then they entered. he exclaimed again.
Have you, then, an education? Have you, then, an education? That explains it.
And also extremely expedient. But the examination? Exactly. she exclaimed
emphatically. he exclaimed in rueful expostulation. That's enough for me! she
exclaimed in mirthful exasperation. What did you do with Erastus? That's easy
enough to answer. So they entered the edge of the swamp. exclaimed Will.

FOXTROT

     What a fib that was! Far from it. Did you find him? How did you find me
out? Where did you find it? That finished me. here's Flint. I forgot all about
it. Have no fear! There are my friends. I've found him! No, no; we will forget
and forgive, only speak! No; you are false and forsworn. What made you so far
forget yourself? Fellow! Doesn't it feel fine to be a bilger? I fancy it's just
about the same here, isn't it? He's one of the finest of fellows. I feel that
I'd like to fight the fellow myself! A fight--a real fight--with fists? France,
it is foully done! Will they fight? And will the French? Will they fight? But I
find it too pleasant to be the recipient of such favors myself just now, to find
fault. it is my fate. Feet--of what use were feet to follow such a flight as
that? But this is fine. She'd have 'em all f--fa--faded away, as the feller
says. Foolishness!
     Found out what? Other folks! Isn't it fine? What foolery was this? Forgive
me, and forget all about it. Have they found him? But freeze to it. Festive was
his favourite adjective. There'll be five flowers. I forgot it too! Her face was
another face. It was just fun, in the first place. Our festive ball-gown. O
father! He feels proud of the fact. It's your fiddle! About a Foot. On the
Finances. Financiering, is it? Such is fame. Both fired. 'Send up a flare!' He
was below me, at first, far in the distance. The artillery fire of the French is
frightful. Then he fell in a faint. It is all for the Fatherland. I was faint.
Forward, soldiers, for France!' His head was fallen forward. It is a fortress of
the first class.
     France is fighting for her existence. All were battle-frenzied, as only
Frenchmen can be. It was Foch! Firing ceased on all fronts. From the French of
Ferdinand Beissier. I fear! The fact is. No, no; far from it, he replied with
fervour. I did at first. And your friend? But the father's fortune had gone!
'Send up a flare!' He was below me, at first, far in the distance. The artillery
fire of the French is frightful. Then he fell in a faint. It is all for the
Fatherland. I was faint. Forward, soldiers, for France!' His head was fallen
forward. It is a fortress of the first class. France is fighting for her
existence. All were battle-frenzied, as only Frenchmen can be. It was Foch!
Firing ceased on all fronts. fire! Other farmers did the same. I hope my fault
will be forgiven.' Far from it. I have forgot the festival, Forgot the joy. Up,
fling the fire into her heart!
     Far from it. I have forgot the festival, Forgot the joy. Up, fling the
fire into her heart! in all fourscore and more. Four fixed prices have I. Are
they not fat and fair to see? 'Come forth!' Friend, the river is free to all.
Why, how now, Fangs! A flame of fire scorched through his forearm. They faced
each other on their feet. We fought. You fought, her father repeated. He fought
furiously to hold his own. You figured! That was fine of you. How can I find
out? Not your fight. More than once she had felt it. Some other fools have found
that dangerous. Don't forget that. So she fought. But don't fool yourself about
him. He's a fool. They had no food. My father's very fond of him. But no use
friends fallin' out. She frightened. Not far, in the face of such a storm. The
half-thawed fish were flung to them in turn.
     Where is Father? So I find you. We'll finish them. You go find your
father. They no find him. Your father's here. He was my friend. We were out of
food. They'll find him. But the fear's in me. That'll be fine. He fell down
here. Don't forget that. About how I figured it. The fellow's life was forfeit.
The fellow's face was ashen. were familiar. Don't forget that. Isn't that just
fine? Or forward? It's funny. They were in the field. How can they find out?
What did you fancy them? That is my favorite. They were once more under the
flag. Find them. I have faith that it will be! It was an old-fashioned
fastening. That's a fact.
     It is too funny. No, I fear not. My fists, is it? Don't fear for me. It
wasn't my fault that I didn't. Why have they such a force here? I can face my
family. Have no fear. Have you any food? Can you find it? Not his friends? No,
father. Her father! Your Father. Your father. My father. I will fetch them and
follow you to the carriage. I have found them; I have found them! Fly, fly the
house at once! His flesh fell away. 'Blossoms to be valued only as they fetch
foretell fruits. Do not forget me; you see that I do not forget you. They have
no friends. It is as follows:--'Dr. You're a fool! We fought fair and square.
Her father? Is fighting. He had his followers with him. Fill her up!
     I was figuring on it. And not too far. There was a flash and faint thud.
You fool. I'd find him. But don't be foolish. He flushed. It's a feeling I have.
If he don't fight you here he'll fight you later. Before all your friends. And
now you have been fighting? Is that fair to me? You are not; and that's why I am
frank. I have fought. By fighting? Failed? Your father. He was staring,
fascinated, into the face of the other. That we were about to fight. You'd
fight? Very full. I have forgotten them. He was in a fury. You fools! At first
he was for fighting at once. Why did I feel that? I'm through with you forever!
We was doing fine. Is that final? Her father?
     I was a fool. The fool! Was it fear because of her? We fought him. You
fool' Won't she find you out? You fools! You're a fool! We fought fair and
square. Her father? Is fighting. He had his followers with him. Fill her up! I
was figuring on it. And not too far. There was a flash and faint thud. You fool.
I'd find him. But don't be foolish. He flushed. It's a feeling I have. If he
don't fight you here he'll fight you later. And now you have been fighting? Is
that fair to me? You are not; and that's why I am frank. I have fought. By
fighting? Failed? Your father. He was staring, fascinated, into the face of the
other. That we were about to fight.
     Very full. I have forgotten them. He was in a fury. You fools! At first he
was for fighting at once. Why did I feel that? I'm through with you forever! We
was doing fine. Is that final? Her father? I was a fool. The fool! Was it fear
because of her? We fought him. You fool' Won't she find you out? You fools!
Festive was his favourite adjective. There'll be five flowers. I forgot it too!
Her face was another face. It was just fun, in the first place. Our festive
ball-gown. Your feeling? I knew you were my friend, and have not forgotten the
gold-thread. My mother has her's, too, and my father has not been forgotten. Far
from it. I fear not. No?--what fault have you to find with this? Father! Father!
     The fact was so. No need to be so feelin'; no you fader, at all. Why bad
to you--he no fader--only fader friend. Bob--Father--father--father! Such were
the facts. It will be real fun filling it up. That's as far as we have got so
far. If only she had not been so foolish! Ferd fairly shouted it at him. It's
not fair. Not fair, flared Billie. Don't be foolish! Fearfully she followed
after. And then they found it. It isn't fair. It is, for a fact! How about it,
fellows? the spirit flown forever! To the field then--to the field-- To the
senate or the field. Father! Who was her father? In fact, it was the very first
which presented itself. He flushed. Fact! I'm a fool! It was flesh of his flesh.
It was all figurative. Then I found him and fought him. That was a fight! But he
was beginning to forget fear.
     You fool! That, in fact, was what he was doing. Flirt with that thick-
head? You're forcing this fight, stranger. If it should be, we have no fears.
Wasn't the fight fair? Fernando was first to speak. Frequently. Is he your
friend? I do the fighting. Why should I favor it? How are yourself and family?
Fly! The other fled. No, father. Here, father! I am foolish! Fernando--he is
there! His formation was a column in mass of about fifty files front. Where did
you find her and when? What fun that will be. They went faster and faster.
Faster, faster, faster they went! Faster, faster, faster they went! Faster,
faster, faster went the merry-go-round. All at first favored them. and who of
his friends were with him? The falsehood of all this is self-evident. This was
proved by the fate of the fugitive. Their fire.
     A fool, the middle finger. Was it a fire? How you frightened me! Forward,
then! Faugh! To the facts, then. About as far. Father! That's fine. That does
not follow. In the fall. It was full of folks. How is the fire? Father always
does that, but this was not father. O, papa, I've forgotten your flowers! Had he
forgotten it? She is not a favorite at all. Have you forgotten me so far as
that? What a fine fellow he is. And now you are going to find fault with me! I
do not forget that. Fairly. But you are very foolish. About as far. Why, did I
frighten you? Father! That's fine. That does not follow. In the fall. It was
full of folks.
     How is the fire? Father always does that, but this was not father. O,
papa, I've forgotten your flowers! Had he forgotten it? She is not a favorite at
all. Have you forgotten me so far as that? What a fine fellow he is. And now you
are going to find fault with me! I do not forget that. Fairly. But you are very
foolish. They forced you into it? A footstool. I am too d--d fat. how am I to
find out? Forgiven for what? Have you forgiven me for falling in love with you?
She has no fear. What filth! I have finished here. He has no friends there. Why,
my friend, why? So friendly, he exclaimed; so very friendly! Far from it. Your
father used to be so fond of them. The flask will stick to your fingers. And how
did you finish him off? Found you out! You follow me? A fool!
     And who is that friend? But you were his father's serfs, before the
freedom. Is it me that you follow? You will not forgive me? I can find my way
through the forest. It is not my father's doing. They were forcing their way to
the front. You follow me? They forced you into it? A footstool. how am I to find
out? Forgiven for what? Have you forgiven me for falling in love with you? She
has no fear. What filth! I have finished here. He has no friends there. Why, my
friend, why? So friendly, he exclaimed; so very friendly! Far from it. Your
father used to be so fond of them. The flask will stick to your fingers. And how
did you finish him off? Found you out! You follow me? A fool! And who is that
friend? But you were his father's serfs, before the freedom. Is it me that you
follow? You will not forgive me?
     I can find my way through the forest. It is not my father's doing. They
were forcing their way to the front. You follow me? That is a fallacy. That is a
fallacy. To-morrow I'll find out. This was fortunate for him. If we don't-- He
did not finish. It was not because of fear for herself. She fell in the snow-
drifts. But she did not flee. She would have followed him in face of fire but
not in face of man. She was not so frightened here. He was free. He had no fear
of the wolf-dog now. Were you very fond of him? I'm very fond of you myself. I
forgot you! Isn't it only fair? They stood face to face. He flushed. That fellow
takes himself as he finds himself! Do you follow me? How far off? Then you
follow out. Where is the fool? That wasn't my fault. I didn't at first. Feels
pretty fair.


GOLF

     How good he's been to me to-day! Good, wasn't it? I'm glad of it! Gracious
me, what are they? Go on; who are they? No recipe can be given for genius. Where
are you going? You're going to do that yourself. Very good, then. I'm going out
to get that notebook, now. Good gracious! By gracious! What good will that do?
My, but you girls are good to look at! Is that the girl? I guess so too! I am
glad of it. But it is not so in Grindwell. So with all games. Are you goin' to
get mad about it? You've got the favour of him--if you wasn't a gal. She was
going to get something for him. By George, she is a good-looker! My
boardin'-house is for gals. she gasped. she groaned. I've got to go down in
town. he grunted. Good God!--what's that? Are they gone--oh, are they gone?
     she gasped. Then swiftly, I've got to--I've got to. You see I'm a good
guesser. Who is this gentleman? The girl glanced at him apprehensively. They've
got Gray! At the Himes boarding-house, a group had gathered by the gate. I've
got to get him to see it as I do. That's good--that's good. The grass. Go it,
old girl! He glanced about. Where are you going? What was she going to do? How
was she to go on? What have you got that for? I've got enough to get through to-
night. What am I going to do? I'm going off--for a while. Then what are you
going to do? I can get it now. But I'm going on thirty-four. Good gracious! They
go. The girl with the Grecian Bend. Where did they get it? The Germans are in
gray. Those stabs were its guns going off. They beat some of the Germans and
some of them they got down. Have you a ghost here?
     So-called ghosts can generally be accounted for. Give her to me. Will you
give it me? How's the gout?' The Germans are in gray. Those stabs were its guns
going off. They beat some of the Germans and some of them they got down. Are
they gone? I praised the goodness of God. where is he gone? Go you there. Gered!
Gered! Then Good, good! Go, now, and get you gone to the butts. Then Guy of
Gisbourne arose. Go to it. The girl gasped and shivered. he growled. They
gloated on her. he growled. Down in the gully. Down you go, then. I'm goin'
a-shootin'. Question now is, do I get a gun? That goes. Got a six-shooter. It
goes. Not guilty, but don't do it again. Where do they get it?
     When I get good and ready. No, but I'm a good guesser. He gave it. They
get the man they go after. Where'll I go? You goin' too? That's good. he
growled. How about this girl? Then we go now. Where's the girl? Where's the
girl? He gamed it out. How goes it? he grunted. Got to grin and bear it. Give it
up. he growled. They were gone. Did they get him? They got him. But I'm glad
you've decided against going in. he gasped. But, great God! Mrs. Sprague: Giddy
girls? The garden of the gods? The garden of the goddesses, you mean, if it is
the rose-field. Go on. On the girl. Who gave her to you?
     I'll get that. Get them! Why should you go? Great God! Guard, don't give
yourself the trouble. Glory! Can we get to them? Then we will go at once. Great
God! I, too, will go with you. Great God! Gibbons.' Then how goes George on with
his studies? This Ode, which is given in the Gent. In the Gent. In the Gent. of
George I. He was very good-humoured and gay. In the Gent. In the Gent. The Gent.
In the Gent. She, in the Gent. What you got? But the girl! There was gold. Now
the other gun. You are too generous. Godwin, get out of your clothes. Now, get
out!
     And when that's gone I'll get more. And out you go. A gunfighter, that's
what he is! Get up and get out! Good-by, George. They greeted him with expectant
glances. And the girl? Then he was gone. You are Garry? What good will that do?
Why didn't I guess it? I'm glad to hear it, Garry. Are you glancing at her, now?
It's the girl. Don't go! She gasped. gasped the incredulous girl. George, you
may go out. But once more George grinned. What you got? But the girl! There was
gold. Now the other gun. You are too generous. Godwin, get out of your clothes.
And when that's gone I'll get more. And out you go. A gunfighter, that's what he
is! Get up and get out! Good-by, George.
     They greeted him with expectant glances. And the girl? Then he was gone.
Don't go! You are Garry? What good will that do? Why didn't I guess it? I'm glad
to hear it, Garry. Are you glancing at her, now? It's the girl. Don't go! She
gasped. gasped the incredulous girl. George, you may go out. But once more
George grinned. That's good--that's good. The grass. Go it, old girl! He glanced
about. Where are you going? What was she going to do? How was she to go on? What
have you got that for? I've got enough to get through to-night. What am I going
to do? I'm going off--for a while. Then what are you going to do? I can get it
now. But I'm going on thirty-four. Go on.
     Cap'in got good fort, too. No good, cap'in. All good--where cap'in? My,
but I'm glad to get it back again. What are you going to do? The girls had not.
How did you guess it? Goodness! Great! Goodness! As if that were all you were
good for! Goodness! Where are you going? Goodness, now I have to get busy!

him he did. But where did he go? Where did you get that? Goodness! A ghost! The
Germans? What you got? Git your hand off that gun! Now you got to get started.
So I had to get you out. Now what you got me here for? I got to! Go on. You've
got a genius for it. No good, he said gravely. It's got to! The gun was no
longer a gun. 'Now,' says he, 'you've got a gun, and I've got a gun, and I'm
going to kill you if I can.' He goes for his gun. I guarantee that. Not that, I
guess! What good is he? she gasped. I guess that's what you are! he groaned.
I've got to have him. he growled. Can we go in her?
     Do we gain on them? They are not in the game. He was gone, actually gone.

Will it go? Grandpa Grumbles was the first to get in. Get me the smelling-salts!

she glad? Grey! Git up, there! Is that why girls are good? I don't think girls
are good. I'm going to-morrow. Now, grandma, please go on. Were there giants,
too? I'll give it to you just as I have it. I am glad he gave it to Will. Has it
got to be so, then? he groaned.

     'God gave and God took!' All of you go out. She does, God be with her!
What will you gain by that? If you will go to No. Good God in heaven! Go on.
Where did he go? You are as the good God made you. What will you gain by it?
They are going to be. They drove on through the gathering gloom. Go on! I got
the better of him, and the good God got the better of me. And he did not go. He
will not give it you. 'God gave and God took!' All of you go out. She does, God
be with her! What will you gain by that? Good God in heaven! Go on. Where did he

the grave? he growled. What's your governor's game? Who, in short, is going to
get off with it? He has got up again, and gone into the Tower.
     What are you going to do now? But then, what of the grave? He's gone--or
they've gone. It's no go for to-night. Will he go? Well, after all, they've only
got the gold. I guess I've got some rights. What are you going to do? What's
gone? I guess not to-day. Which we will be only too glad to do. Goodness
gracious! Then here goes! it's you, is it, general? But how are you going to get
out? It's gone! Glad of it. But--he's got a gun! Gone on! He goes to-morrow.
Where did you go to? Why not go to-morrow? he gasped. On a girl's ball-dress
too. In the garden? I am only too glad to have it again. The girl gave a shiver.
I am so grateful for the confidence you have given me. Are they all gone? It is
there I am going.

I am hoping to do. What has happened to him? The house is a large house. Is he a
hermit? I have no home for her; what am I to do?
     Will it hurt you to-day? Now wasn't that humiliating? But had it helped
her? And what will happen then? She is--happier. What a short hour and a half!

happened to you? It was not in my heart to do that! That has helped me. So
Linnet hoped and hoped. And a house of his own. I hope it was while you were
doing it. I hate to hear it mentioned. I was so happy. My husband. I have heard
them before. I hope not. She had only half an hour. I will not help you unless
you help yourself. He had heard all this before. I only hope she will make you
happy. But I have heard what it is. There is no help for it. I hope so. And
happy? She only had half an hour. Are they happy?
     Humanity was his hobby. If it had been you, I should not have hated you.
And I hate her! I hate her. They did not hate each other. I hate it! He is not
your husband! she hissed. He did not heed them. I hope it is. he hissed. I
helped him. I hate to hear it mentioned. I was so happy. My husband. I have
heard them before. I hope not. She had only half an hour. I will not help you
unless you help yourself. He had heard all this before. I only hope she will
make you happy. But I have heard what it is. There is no help for it. I hope so.
And happy? She only had half an hour. Are they happy? Humanity was his hobby. If
it had been you, I should not have hated you. And I hate her!

husband! she hissed. He did not heed them. I hope it is. he hissed. I helped
him. Highrs. & S. Highrs. Hill, Major-General J. Hodgson, Major-General. Highrs.
& S. Highrs. Hill, Major-General J. Hodgson, Major-General. What, ho! how hot it
will be!' --Now he is happy. With both hands she turned up his head. He was
hatless. He held his head up. There was a queer humming over their heads. He was
hurt. She held out her hand. Home! Joan, too, held out a hand. They were happy
in their swamp home. His head hung low. He was half again as heavy. He was not
hungry.
     Both had holds. There was hunting now. Harker raised a hand. Did you hear
it? I heard it! What is this that I hear? What is this that I hear? What
happened then? An hour or more, has he? Not as I've heard. But he hates them.
You did me the honor-- No, no! Who in hell are you? Don't hurry. Hector! You'd
have been more than human if you hadn't. Hush! All yours, Hector! But after that
we made some heavy; hauls. And the thing he held in his own hand? Hush! 's are
in a hurry! 'Ware, hawks! I hope he didn't hurt himself badly, that's all.
What's hard on you, Bluff, is just happiness to them. What harm did he do? what
has happened now? What happened to you? Hey, fellers, d'ye hear that? They
hurried on.

But you don't know it. Do you know them? Do you know that, too?
     She did not know whom. You and I know him. He killed a keeper before I
finished him off. You know them? I know it. Who knows? I know. I don't know. You
know he does not--you know he does not! I know not what it is. We know it; that
is all. I know that! Is that all he knows? And then I kicked him out for you. He
knows that! he knows that. I know that. I do not know. I do not know why. No, I
did not know you. I did not know it before. You know what he is. kill them--kill
them! You are very kind to me. Who knows? And she's ours, Kazan, all ours! He
knew--and I didn't. He knew what it was. I kill t'ousand more. But Kazan was
among his own kind.
     It'll do that--or kill 'im! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I
know who you are and what you are! I know who he is and what he is. I knew it! I
knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I know who you are and what you are! I know who
he is and what he is. My half-brother, you know? I know it! I didn't know that!
If he is-- I know. As to that I don't know. Do you know him? I don't know. You
know that. The keyword! 'Ow should I know? And you know--you knew--that he was
mad. But I do know it. This is Kamp Kill Kare, you know. I don't know. But you
don't know it all. You know him? You know him?


LIMA

     Don't I look as if I had? Too late for that. What is it, lad? On my left;
look at the hands. Who is lost here? He just said he had but a little while to
live. Who is Ludmilla? All that's left of me. But Lucindy, where was she? Long
life to it! We will listen to that. But this is no more Literature than the
masquerade is Life. and there was light. and lo! Look at that! I lied. No such
luck! Not in the least. look there! Let love be its own inspiration! Let love be
its own inspiration! But is it not too late? I am a house-prisoner no longer! It
was low, wide-seated, high-backed, broad, and long. He laughed a little. I do
love to be out-of-doors. It looks like an orchid. He was lookin' at you. This
won't last long. You'd look lovely in it.
     Gray looked, and laughed a little. Laughed at--you? Just look at that,
will you? That she was not a lady? The little liar! Look in there. He laughed a
little ruefully. Likely he's been led, and that slowly. It's a lie! Some of 'em
have a lot of sense left. Lord A'mighty! That's like Laurelly. Then he laughed.
Looks like they'd turned out. Lord, Lord; Did you hear that, Lydia? Look there,
he whispered, laughingly. Just a little? A very little? She, too, was listening.
And I laid it up there. He leered at her. How long was it? A large photograph on
a little shelf-easel. But I don't like you any more. Lulu lowered her eyes. he
laughed. Again he laughed. This laughter was intoxicating to Lulu. This was like
lying, for its own sake. He was looking away from her, and she looked at him.
     They laughed. They laughed. Her loyalty stirred Lulu. At last Ninian
looked at her. They were all looking at her. They were looking at Lulu again.
She's just a little, little girl. They looked, and it was Lulu. Lulu looked at
him with parted lips. They all listened. Lulu lit with pleasure. But it wasn't
him left me. The letter's there. What is it, Lulu? Lulu looked at the clock.
Lulu listened and read all. She looked at him now. I've lived here all my life--
on your money. And, he added, she's a little liar. Lulie, she said, why, Lulie.
And letters, too. Lost his life!--who knows? You can look for yourselves.
Lebanon is just over the line. We left at eight-thirty. All were loaded down.
Long live France! This is a lie. Where do you live? Let them laugh.
     She didn't like the Dwarf, and he didn't like her. Both lost their lives
for their temerity. Both lost their lives for their temerity. All were loaded
down. The last letter from Lieut. Long live France! This is a lie. Look a little
before thee. My children lost, my land, my lord. Let lie . the love we seek not
is no love. And, lo! A lover once, will alway love again. Low, low, thou liest!
Lose her not! My children lost, my land, my lord. Let lie . the love we seek not
is no love. A lover once, will alway love again. Low, low, thou liest! Lose her
not! listen to the lad! Then Robin laughed loudly too. How now, lads? Is it not
so, my lads? La there, now! At this, the King laughed loud and long. Robin
laughed and laughed. If you don't let me up-- You'll do what? The lord of her
life had spoken. The lass is no' for you or the like o' you. On the peck, looks
like.
     Where's the liquor? It was a lazy, sleepy life. Very likely you've saved
my life. It was that li'l' hell-cat of McRae. How's the leg? She did, later,
over the camp-fire. We're here looking for him. He loved her. I'm not lookin'
for them. That's a lie! Lucky I was Johnnie-on-the-Spot. She was lost. To the
left! Looky here. She laughed. He laughed. But there's a locket. Looks like he
don't know what he's doing. No light at all? Look out for him. Now looky here,
you can laugh at me all you've a mind to. he laughed. He laughed. Whom I love my
mother loves. No: it was my luck. Isn't it lovely? He is very low. How lovely it
is! A little less than all is much too little for me. When they do I will listen
to you.
     I am commander-in-chief only in law. He is not in the lists. He's in the
lockup there. Lead on. The lines that tied them were long. How long will it
last? He looked up. Don't lie, now--you'll get more lashes for it. What had he
learned? I--I will not let you leave me again. He laughed. How did you learn I
was here? He moved his left leg. Where has she been of late? 'To MRS. LUCY
PORTER, IN LICHFIELD. She left her little substance to a charity-school. 'To
MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD. 'To MRS. LUCY PORTER, IN LICHFIELD. 'Indeed, my
Lord, I will not. She has left me. Them and a lot more. Hard luck, Lefty. Then
Levine. It is no longer what it was. But Lester was not single-handed. Lou is my
last hope! She truly loves this Landis? A little. But what if she truly loved
Landis? Lots of 'em.
     Why do you look like that? But leave that to Lord Nick. Leave now? The
lips of Landis parted. You shouldn't listen to it. Now you laugh at me. and
Nelly Lebrun laughed. You are laughing, now. Because he's in love--with me. You
have that long. Now look at me. I liked the careless life. And Lester and Lebrun
split with me. You're in love with her? Who am I to love her? She loves Landis.
In Lebrun's. And what will be in Lebrun's? I looked in on her a little while
ago. They loved her, both of them. I laughed at 'em. Who was left? Look at this!
It's a lie! But I was too late. He will live? He will live? Them and a lot more.
Hard luck, Lefty. Then Levine.
     It is no longer what it was. But Lester was not single-handed. Lou is my
last hope! She truly loves this Landis? A little. But what if she truly loved
Landis? Lots of 'em. But leave that to Lord Nick. Leave now? But I'd kind of
like to look on! The lips of Landis parted. You shouldn't listen to it. Now you
laugh at me. and Nelly Lebrun laughed. You are laughing, now. Because he's in
love--with me. You have that long. Now look at me. I liked the careless life.
And Lester and Lebrun split with me. You're in love with her? Who am I to love
her? She loves Landis. In Lebrun's. And what will be in Lebrun's? I looked in on
her a little while ago. They loved her, both of them. I laughed at 'em. Who was
left? Look at this!
     It's a lie! But I was too late. He will live? He will live? Just a little?
A very little? She, too, was listening. And I laid it up there. He leered at
her. How long was it? A large photograph on a little shelf-easel. But I don't
like you any more. Lulu lowered her eyes. he laughed. Again he laughed. This
laughter was intoxicating to Lulu. This was like lying, for its own sake. He was
looking away from her, and she looked at him. They laughed. They laughed. Her
loyalty stirred Lulu. At last Ninian looked at her. They were all looking at
her. They were looking at Lulu again. They looked, and it was Lulu. Lulu looked
at him with parted lips. They all listened. Lulu lit with pleasure. But it
wasn't him left me. The letter's there.
     Lulu looked at the clock. That's likely. Lulu listened and read all. She
looked at him now. I've lived here all my life--on your money. And, he added,
she's a little liar. What he like?--Like land, to be sure. Longfellow. The likes
of her, is it! It is now too late. It's the likes of you that loves to convarse.
It is now too late. We let them lie where they fell. They should not, love.
Laura, what did you do that for? Now how about lunch? What are they like?
laughed Laura, but they promised just the same. For myself I just love candle
light. she asked, with a little laugh. I didn't like the looks of those men.
with me The light of Life is o'er! Out--out are the lights--out all! The same,
my love. Learned as few are learned. Lead on! My Lalage--my love! Merrily live
and long! There was laughter again. Look there!
     He looked up. It had been a move like lightning. Who are you and where do
you figure on letting me loose? He licked his lips and grinned again. He let out
some of my life, but he let in a lot of knowledge. I lived with it. I shot him
through the left leg. Look out! Where'd you like to have it? Look out! He looked
again. What luck? Look at that. do I look like a Britisher? Now listen to me,
lad. she answered with a little laugh. Miss Lane, how did you learn this? Learn
it! 'Has she no other lover?' Just as when we left. Bushy-Tail looked cross-
eyed. He looked him up and down. We will not let Bushy-Tail in. Look out, look
out! All the while the lion roared louder and louder. and they all laughed. A
lover, the last or little finger. Who were they who so loved as no others had
loved? ---- Look at Letty, said I, succeeding at last in a laugh. Not in the
least.
     What is it, Sally?--what do I look like? is he dead?--no life left? Let me
up, he said, at length. But it was too late. Nor was it lost. He laughed.
Lethal? We all landed at once. You may laugh at them, if you like. Look here,
now. She longed, oh, how she longed! She did not care if Linnet had laughed. And
wasn't the one at Laodicea lukewarm? How I do love that. You look terribly like
it. What do they look like? Not how she looked to-day! She was more like him
than he was like her. Lifting the latch she staggered in. How long have you been
here? Isn't it lovely? I have learned that. And then she laughed. But isn't this
a long letter? He was very warm-hearted and lovable. She isn't like a little
girl now, is she? I'll light the lamps myself. That had been a long letter;
perhaps too long. They love Linnet. And where is Linnet?
     Don't laugh at me. Does he like that? And they are all little ladies. And
now they had Prue to love and to live for. You will like that. Will she like
that? Did you love him? He had your mamma and she loved him, and then he had you
and you loved him. And then she laughed. Does he like the life? And learn
housekeeping from Linnet. No; she was like your mother; only hers has lasted so
long. How she lives in him! Not like this. Lay her down flat, Linnet. They were
older, and they loved each other, and left him to me. You were never so lovely
in your life. he laughed. But it's too late now. Was she not living a lie? They
both did the will of the Lord. How you lectured me then! It was not like the
letters of the other time. Marjorie looked at her and loved her. I had not
looked upon it in that light. What do you feel like listening to? She longed,
oh, how she longed! She did not care if Linnet had laughed. And wasn't the one
at Laodicea lukewarm? How I do love that.
     What do they look like? Not how she looked to-day! She was more like him
than he was like her. Lifting the latch she staggered in. How long have you been
here? Isn't it lovely? I have learned that. And then she laughed. But isn't this
a long letter? He was very warm-hearted and lovable. Is it like this? She isn't
like a little girl now, is she? I'll light the lamps myself. That had been a
long letter; perhaps too long. They love Linnet. And where is Linnet? Don't
laugh at me. Does he like that? And they are all little ladies. And now they had
Prue to love and to live for. You will like that. Will she like that? Did you
love him? He had your mamma and she loved him, and then he had you and you loved
him. And then she laughed. Does he like the life? And learn housekeeping from
Linnet. No; she was like your mother; only hers has lasted so long. How she
lives in him! Lay her down flat, Linnet.
     They were older, and they loved each other, and left him to me. You were
never so lovely in your life. he laughed. But it's too late now. Was she not
living a lie? They both did the will of the Lord. How you lectured me then! It
was not like the letters of the other time. Marjorie looked at her and loved
her. I had not looked upon it in that light. Steinmetz looked down at him with a
little laugh. We all live on each other. He gave a little laugh. You--in London?
Did she love him? He is late. Have you no light? He will live. You are a lazy
good-for-nothing. How long have you been doing this? Where does she live? Where
does she live? In London. The Lanovitches. They will laugh at you. Let them
laugh! It is too late now. He loves a lord, 'Ce Vassili.' The Count Lanovitch
was looking at the lamp. She looked up at him.
     Loaded? Leave me with him. I should love it. They were not the same as
they had been in London. Lose what? she laughed. She gave a little laugh. There
was a little laugh. But it will not be for long. But the ladies--what of them?
She looked up. Or you can live in Paris, at last. He gave a little laugh. What
is that light? Look out! passed from lip to lip. Some lives are so. Steinmetz
looked down at him with a little laugh. We all live on each other. He gave a
little laugh. You--in London? He is late. Have you no light? He will live. You
are a lazy good-for-nothing. How long have you been doing this? What is she
like? Where does she live? Where does she live? In London.
     The Lanovitches. They will laugh at you. Let them laugh! It is too late
now. He loves a lord, 'Ce Vassili.' The Count Lanovitch was looking at the lamp.
She looked up at him. Loaded? Leave me with him. I should love it. They were not
the same as they had been in London. Lose what? she laughed. She gave a little
laugh. There was a little laugh. But it will not be for long. But the ladies--
what of them? It did not last long. She looked up. Or you can live in Paris, at
last. He gave a little laugh. What is that light? Look out! passed from lip to
lip. Some lives are so. There were large depots down the line too. I have just
left them. Longley, Major-General. There were large depts down the line too. I
have just left them.
     Longley, Major-General. Look at that! He doesn't like you, she laughed at
him softly. She did love him. She looked like a child. It was life. He looked
in. There was no longer a little creek below them. He had lived among them two-
thirds of his life. Now, look here. He, too, was listening. The soreness left
his limbs. And then he leaped. Both listened. It was no longer there. 'Tis a
lie! It was no longer there. 'Tis a lie! Try to look at it like that. he
laughed. He laughed. He laughed. he murmured, with a low light laugh. He
laughed. She looked up at him. Fancy his living like that! Don't leave all the
V.C. There she'll lie, snug as you like. Life had left the body which reason had
left long before. She looked up at him.
     I meant that, because I loved him, and he loved me. I can lift him now.
Lights! He listened again. You like having the laugh of people. he laughed. Look
there! Just keep up a little while longer. The other laughed. Listen to him.
Listen to that, will you? Once again luck favored the lad. How long did you lie
there? The three lads looked at each other. laughed the other. With the ladder?
Here we are at the Lion. Let him worry if he likes. Is that a letter? She
laughed. Then she laughed. She laughed. They had not liked it, and the horses
had not liked it. I can't laugh as I should like to. He had his lantern, as I
had. He'll let you in, though it's late. Very little. It had been left in the
doing--for me. He'll not like it,--we all know as he'll not like it. I did not
like the look of the man.


MIKE

     Mrs. May she? mildly returned Mrs. Mrs. he asked, after a moment's
meditation. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. And the man? He was a man! I am to be married in May.
What do you mean? I mean mischievously, not malignantly wicked. Not much. are
you out of your mind? Mercy, what's that? What is the matter? He has missed his
mark. Their movement is not self-determined, self-sustained. In ordinary moods
he must be very much as ordinary men, and it is in these we meet him. But no man
can do this again. How many of you? That is all, Mr. muttered Midshipman
Pennington. What does this mean? Once more may do it! What do you mean? muttered
Dan miserably. The midshipmen were being marched in to dinner. muttered the
marine.
     Who is this Mr. Who were the men? He'll make his mark in the Navy. Why,
what does this mean? he muttered. What is the matter? Judges, mayors, Congress-
men, Mr. Gurreeb-purwan, O munificent and merciful! What was, then, the
conjuration and the mighty magic? What's the matter with you? She must have been
out of her mind. After all, weren't you maybe better off up in these mountains?
It was all over in a moment. Maybe you might just leave them with her. whispered
Mandy Meacham to herself. What's the matter with you? What do you make of that?
What's the matter? Your mother! Mother--Oh, mother! What's the matter? That must
be it. To-morrow morning. Why shouldn't I marry her? He's missing. They'll
murder him! Mother's got money. Mother's--mother's married again, she managed
finally to say. Maybe it was the silver mine. Mind out!
     she moaned. What do I make of it? Here's this mine of ours. He marched by
her. Where'd you been if she hadn't married? It's my mother and me. Maybe she
does. Where you been mostly? She must, she must participate. Mrs. And was he not
a magistrate? Mother too. That's mine, too. What did it mean? she met this.
Married? He must have. No, no, mother. His manner, it mounted too. Mother!
Mother! She was by no means above self-sympathy. And so was the music. But,
mother! And then it was all a mistake. He mulled it. But it was not Monona.
We're married--just now. No marriage about it! Is it not better to be a mountain
than a mole?
     April is a model month. But the Midway. Who was Miller? Tell a man he may
not marry, and he will; that he must marry, and he won't. Few of them have any
money. There were miles and miles of it. What does this mean? 'We have to make
out the best we can,' is his motto. 'Think of what this means. By Mary Spencer-
Warren. By A. G. Morrison. The Mirror. It may not, but on the other hand it may.
Now what do you mean to do? What do you mean? It was too much for him! by Mavor
& Meredith. by Mason. No. What do you mean, Lili-Tsee? What do I mean? Lili-
Tsee, what do you mean? Few of them have any money. There were miles and miles
of it. What does this mean? 'We have to make out the best we can,' is his motto.
'Think of what this means. Matilda, what are you doing here? But we were off in
a few moments. is this man become mad? Mend it I cannot, but mar it I may,
perhaps.
     I would I had him here now, man to man! But what manner of man is he, lad?
I will be mine own, and no man in all merry England shall be my master. Is it
not so, my merry men all? Be merry, man. Is it not so, my merry men all? Marry
come up with a murrain! Merry was the meal. What means this? You mean we can.
What'll be the meanin' o' this? What's it all about, McRae? Make up yore mind to
that. Morse did not know what he meant to do with him. They'd murder him. We're
man to man. Some, maybe, Morse assented. Miss McRae, I'll not forget this. Why
mustn't I? Could he have made a mistake? The man stood there for a second,
making up his mind to move on. Don't move. Mother o' Moses, don't shoot. How
many more of you? Never mind about that, Miss McRae. The manager of the C.N.
What does this mean? Mother's with Mrs. Meanin'? To him McRae was a great man.
     And how many? What was the motive in the back of his mind? Meanin'--?
That's our motto. I've made up my mind since. Oh, Mother--Mother! It doesn't
matter much why I'm going. Of such was the North-West Mounted. What's that mean?
Might be that. It moved. Now we'll mush. The man had moved. He made a motion to
rise. And again he murmured the motto of the Mounted Police. Now have I, McRae?
What does this mean? So Vincent was made much of. How many men, about? Not a
mouthful. What's the matter? At them, men! It is not McDowell. What can it mean?
There must surely be some mistake. I mean we are not ready yet to put our many
million men on the march. I mean the Caribees--were there many? He's at
Manassas. And his mother, what must her state of mind be? And his mother?
     And you have a mother? But the men didn't seem to mind it much. We have
all misunderstood him. But I'm mighty glad I met you. How will you manage? No;
she hadn't mentioned it. I might. It's money, my boy, money. Where are the
matches? And what might not happen during those momentous months? That is as
much as a man can speak for. They are mounted. what does it mean? Murdered, when
he should have found merry. You must do it to-night and to-morrow. have mercy!
They might be miles from the spot! How do you mean? she has so much self-
control! You must go to McClellan. But make your mind easy. I must--I must go
with you! What did this mean? She must have him now to herself. Good-by, miss.
What does this mean? Good-by, miss. What does that mean? I mean it. I have no
money.
     It is murder. What does it mean? Here, by some mysterious means, we were
all dispersed. What do you mean? The Bramins are the mastiffs of mankind.' 'He
must be a weak man, who is to be so moved.' May GOD have mercy on him. May he
have mercy on me.' 'DEAR MADAM, 'Mrs. How does Miss Mary? 'Sir, I will not allow
this man to have merit. Miss Hawkins Memoirs, i. and Med. Often mentioned in
Mme. H. More's Memoirs, i. Dr. Maty Memoirs of Chesterfield, i. and Med. and
Med. I was much moved. Miss Hawkins Memoirs, i. That he is mistaken is shown by
Mme. and Med. H. More's Memoirs, i. Motherly. and Med. Missed him. What you
mean? Only for a moment. No matter where. What's the matter?
     Be off with you, Mr. Eight miles, that's not much! You are a mind reader,
Mr. Who mentioned money? What was in his mind? Money? he muttered. And he was a
man's man, no doubt of that. muttered the other. The money is now mine. D'you
mean that? It's murder! But the mint! And then the mines? The mines! You've made
your point, she murmured. What are you, Mr. He has me in mind. I mustn't sit
down with you, Mr. Do you mean that? Just what does he mean to you? Do you mean
to say that you are making all! I mean it! In Milligan's, then. By all means. So
much for that. And he made no move at you? But you might not. It may be that my
men will not agree with me. Maybe I am--through with you.
     Maybe the Pedlar, maybe Harry Masters, maybe Lester, maybe me! I meant it.
Do you mean it? Missed him. Only for a moment. No matter where. What's the
matter? Be off with you, Mr. Eight miles, that's not much! You are a mind
reader, Mr. Who mentioned money? What was in his mind? Money? he muttered. And
he was a man's man, no doubt of that. muttered the other. The money is now mine.
D'you mean that? It's murder! But the mint! And then the mines? The mines!
You've made your point, she murmured. What are you, Mr. He has me in mind. I
mustn't sit down with you, Mr. Do you mean that? Just what does he mean to you?
I mean it! I'll meet you in--Milligan's?
     In Milligan's, then. By all means. So much for that. And he made no move
at you? But you might not. It may be that my men will not agree with me. Maybe I
am--through with you. Maybe the Pedlar, maybe Harry Masters, maybe Lester, maybe
me! What do you mean? I meant it. Do you mean it? He marched by her. Where'd you
been if she hadn't married? It's my mother and me. Maybe she does. Where you
been mostly? She must, she must participate. Mrs. And was he not a magistrate?
Mother too. That's mine, too. What did it mean? she met this. Married? He must
have. No, no, mother. His manner, it mounted too. Mother! Mother! She was by no
means above self-sympathy.
     And so was the music. But, mother! What do you mean? And then it was all a
mistake. He mulled it. But it was not Monona. We're married--just now. No
marriage about it! How much of him? Is it so, mother? Where are you from, Mike?
How is it, Mr. Can this be my mother? What can they mean, mother? This must be a
mistake! That may be your opinion, Mr. What you make him for, cap'in? Mean to be
cap'in, ag'in? Was that made in a minute, think you? What can you--what do you
mean?--What can I--what can Maud have to do with this? Mother!--mother! Them
that likes masters and mistresses may have them, for all me; but it riles me to
meet with meanness. This is a bold measure, Mr. We must proceed more
methodically. Is it the Missus? The major was not mistaken. No matter who is
with me. How is my mother? My mother is miserable on my account! This is
yourself, Maud!
     I mean of my mother--of Maud Yeardley; the wife of my father, Major
Meredith. This, then, Maud, was your own--your real mother! Is it what do they
mane? Montgomery. The man is a commander-in-chief--a captain-general. You were
much mistaken in that, Joel. What cap'in mean, now? Are there many pale-faces in
it? Why you t'ink merciless? No moccasin-- much boot. That was mighty injanious
of you, Miss Maud! Is it meself that 's a messenger? That was the majjor's.
Still there must have been some message. Where cap'in?--Where major? Mind
not'ing. She my moder, too! Mortality! It makes me mad that you should be
troubled with it. Mother! What's the matter? It's a machine--it must be a
machine--out on the road. It simply must have been a machine. They made a
mistake. But what does it mean? What's the matter? Where's Mrs. What do you
mean? For a minute they stood motionless. Now what's the matter?
     What do you mean? It will give you that much more money to have for
yourself. --what's the matter? and make it up, I say, this minute! Madam, what
is it? That's meant for me. Was I much mourned, my Eiros? Who was her mother!
D'you mean that? He must make for that goal. Is that your man? You think it
don't mean much. I'm not the only man that's faster'n you are. I didn't mean to!
I haven't any money. You'd be a mess this minute, if it wasn't for Hunter! You
mean by that? I may have tripped him which I didn't mean to. Not much. How is
little Morgianna this morning? What was the matter? What meeting? Meeting with
Lieutenant Matson. I don't moind that. She might marry a Lord! How is this, Mr.
We must march to Halifax. Mrs. Mrs. Who are you, misther?
     I wanted money, and money I must have. Was he married then? Is she
married? How many men have you? What's the matter, Morgianna? You miss the mark.
Morgianna, you here! Many, Miss Lane. O, murther! Your marriage with Lieutenant
Matson. Then, Morgianna, who was it? Mariana is now no more. What does it all
mean? Will you make a rocking-horse? About midsummer B.C. Magic and Magical
rites. Med. The monogram marks its date. I did not mean to. What is the matter?
Mildred, who was with him? Hooray for Miss Mac! A soldier is but a mortal man.
There were but few mirrors. And what may that be? What mean you? These are
marked with: missing text. There, Mousie, here you are! mimicked Miss Prudence.
If that's what it means, it means delightful!
     And your mother had to get married, too. Yours may be better than mine.
Marjorie, what is the matter? Did you miss it? When she was speaking to him,
too, murmured Marjorie. What does that mean to you, Marjorie? And she has so
much to do. In the morning. Your master is not a hard master. Here comes your
mother with her message. You might have, both of you! What will your mother do?
And the master. Then he must be sixty-four. I guess she will miss you, Marjorie.
Is that your mamma up there? How rejoiced his mother must be! But, first--a
moment, Marjorie. There's so much to be faithful in, Morris. Is he before the
mast? It was mean! she moaned. Then it does make a difference to man. Why,
Marjorie! Morris. About Morris? And Mrs. Morris will be glad to have her with
mother. Your mother will have to do it. And that is what I mean.
     Where's Marjorie? Morris! Must I tell his mother? Where is Morris? His
mother! moaned Marjorie. Mrs. And Morris's! And she was making haste with all
her might. I mean that. Morris! Mrs. What had her mother meant? I like to mingle
with men. O, mother! mother! O, mother, mother, how could you? Mother! It may
be. These are marked with: missing text. There, Mousie, here you are! mimicked
Miss Prudence. If that's what it means, it means delightful! And your mother had
to get married, too. Yours may be better than mine. Marjorie, what is the
matter? Did you miss it? When she was speaking to him, too, murmured Marjorie.
What does that mean to you, Marjorie? And she has so much to do.

Marjorie.
     Mrs. What do you mean? And Morris's! And she was making haste with all her
might. I mean that. Morris! Mrs. What had her mother meant? I like to mingle
with men. O, mother! mother! O, mother, mother, how could you? Mother! You must
trust to me in this matter. For money, too! he muttered. It was a misfortune.
But we have no matches. It was more than manly. This Moscow man is eccentric.
She was not modern at all. How can Mme. Madame might be thirty-five! They had
been married a month. Only--only I must have Maggie with me. What mischief are
you about? He is up to some mischief. Does that matter? Is it not so, Mme. Now,
when may that be?
     What about money? it does not matter much. It was a moment for mental
reservations. There is no mistaking it. We may meet again--or we may not. This
was all marsh, was it not? Maggie paused for a moment. She will be down in a
minute. To raise him up and make a man of him. Not very much, mademoiselle, he
answered. I have a good memory, madame. What do you mean? Money? The Mir makes
no taxes. The man laughed mysteriously. The man made no reply. You must do the
same. What do you mean? What do you mean? Who is this man? The moujiks avoid me
when they meet me. I do not think that it matters much. He was not a subtle-
minded man at all. What means? She was on her mettle. Mine--such as they are,
Stepan--must be managed by myself. It was a motive. They are mad! To this Maggie
made no answer. What is the meaning of it?
     he muttered. It is mademoiselle! You must trust to me in this matter. For
money, too! he muttered. It was a misfortune. But we have no matches. It was
more than manly. This Moscow man is eccentric. She was not modern at all. How
can Mme. Madame might be thirty-five! They had been married a month. Only--only

it? he muttered. What do you mean? He had met his match. Maclean, Brigadier-
General. He had met his match. Maclean, Brigadier-General. Marshall was a noble
man. How is your memory? He was a member of the Seventh Minnesota. It was but
for a moment. Marshall.

It's the man! Then why was McCready there? He did not mind it now. It was The
Message. she moaned. May I have them? He was master. He mistrusted the moving
shadows. In this the beavers were the masters of men. That was his method. He
had made the find on the McFarlane. And it was there that she had mothered her
first-born. Marchons! Marchons. By Moses! Why, that must mean the stake yonder;
that must be the mark. Why, that must mean the stake yonder; that must be the
mark. Mary, where should I have been? money. But you mustn't mew down here, and
you must have lots of milk and cream. It doesn't matter in the least, she
murmured. I mean it. Am I misinterpreting what was in your mind? As it might he,
or as it might not. About 'ow much d'ye reckon there might be by now? You must
have known what I meant.
     You must make what you can of it. And Morocco itself! It must be there.
There's millions, millions of it! You must make your examination. A matter of
principle with you, was it, Mr. Did he make a will? You've managed to mix things
up so! But then you mix that up with the money! It was mixed up with it. I
didn't do the mixing. I'm afraid I might be as much as half-an-hour. Well--maybe
it was, and maybe it wasn't. But it isn't mainly that. They met Mary's. For a
moment Mary fenced. How many were there? We mixed up some in the start, but they
were too many for me. What's the matter? I don't mean to; but I must have some
light. Not much. Make up your mind it's so. A mine--and here? Then I met Will,
here. What's the matter with him? How many of you are there? Not much. Morriston
has plenty of money? What's the matter? What do you make of it?
     It is very mysterious all the same. Miss Morriston asked. Nor were they
mine. Then they must be his, Morriston concluded. It is very mysterious. Miss
Morriston was not present. Miss Morriston thought a moment. Why, man, Muriel and
I were in the room below. Miss Morriston does not know? What do you mean? With
Mr. he murmured. What do you make of this? Miss Morriston asked. Miss Morriston
asked. You may trust me, Miss Morriston, he murmured. But the man. It was all
very mysterious. What's the matter? Not Miss Morriston's? Marriage? The marks on
my dress you mean? The mystery is made clear. By all means, Morriston assented.
And Miss Morriston? In a few minutes she made her appearance. But it does not
much matter. What did it mean? Miss Morriston! He is-- Mr.


NOVEMBER

     What does it need? There is no need of any. Isn't it nice? I'll never
forget that night. What's up naow? How, Nell? And nothing more? What next? None
of that, now, you yellow-face! His name? The nerve! That night I never slept.
There--isn't that nice? They're nickel. They was but a nickel. How nice that is!
And if I don't do it, you needn't have me. Nothing--nothing --nothing! Uh-huh,
nodded the newcomer. The nourishment is next to the skin. I've noticed that!
There was nothing. What's your name? Not Neenyun, but nearly Neenyun. Why, none.
Ninian's! Haven't you noticed that? Do you need this? It's from Ninian. How
noble!
     The noise? But, what's in a name? More about it in my next. --Norfolk

necessary to sacrifice all for her. Never was it more necessary to sacrifice all
for her. I was of the number. I have nothing to do with him. This is what I
never can do. Be near to me now. 'Tis not for her; She is as naught to me. Be
near to me now. 'Tis not for her; She is as naught to me. I have near kin of
that name. A nitchie's a nitchie. Didn't notice. You're a nephew of C.N. What's
in a name? Nothing more. My notion, too. Nothing a-tall. But there was none. She
nodded that she was. It was neck or nothing. The other nodded. They're nice.
Nothin' a-tall. So we'll none of that.
     They are near it; they are under it! It never will. They are negroes. I'll
be nineteen in January next. This will never do. He--he is near. Nothing. I
never heard that name here. But I don't need it. And the next? 'Consented to the
insertion of their names their own nomination. It is nothing. He is not
neglected. 'We cannot have nonpareils.' Nothing at all. Nothing. Nothing.' But
it is not necessary.' What's your name? Not on such a night. But on such a night
as this? Nothing. I don't need to name no names. Nothing. Nelly! This is Nick.
There was nothing to do. Nope. This is nothin'! You have the note from me?
     But I did it for you, Nick. What's your name? Not on such a night. But on
such a night as this? Nothing. Nothing. I don't need to name no names. Nothing.

nearly Neenyun. Why, none. Neither can you. Ninian's! Nope. Haven't you noticed
that? Do you need this? It's from Ninian. His name is Nick. What can I care for
your news, Nick? That does it--that it does, Nicholas.
     The news! Neither. Good night, Nick. It's just that; and no need of ca'ing
it by anither name. News! This will never do, O'Hearn. Nick's a cr'ature! Nick's
a cr'ature! Is it you, Nick? is it so, Nick!--can it be so! Now, what do we do
next? None of that! None of that! That noise! --Non. --Non. I've news for you

What is her name? That is all nothing! Nothing! How is the night? I never will!
     The neighboring church-clock tolled nine. Nominally. Nothing new! Now what
was she to do next? Nothing! Nothing. But you need not be. Neither do I. What
was his name? And that's the school-master's name. or at night? That's all
nonsense. No, he never was after that. Having only each other, it was natural,
was it not? I never, never will, she promised. Did you notice that? I never did
that! It was in the newspaper. Nothing new! Now what was she to do next?
Nothing! Nothing. But you need not be. Neither do I. What was his name? And
that's the school-master's name. or at night? That's all nonsense. No, he never
was after that. Having only each other, it was natural, was it not?
     I never, never will, she promised. Did you notice that? I never did that!
It was in the newspaper. That is nothing. Nothing. About half-past nine. What is
her name? Perhaps you never noticed. What news? Nerves! Need it be such? It was
all in all to her; to him it was nothing. She naturally--he! Have you noticed
that? Nothing. Next! It is not the Nihilists. No; it is not the Nihilists.
Neither. That is nothing. Nothing. About half-past nine. What is her name?
Perhaps you never noticed. What news? Nerves! Need it be such? It was all in all
to her; to him it was nothing. She naturally--he!
     Have you noticed that? Nothing. Next! It is not the Nihilists. No; it is
not the Nihilists. Next! Next! Next! But it was very near now. This was new.
Next Tuesday night. Then he nodded. What was the name? What a name, too! We're
nearly there. Naylor. And you too, Mr. Naylor? Naylor? Naylor? Naylor? Naylor.
Naylor. It was not needed. what a night! It will be a nuisance for you. She has
none. Naturally. Naturally. Naturally. It will be there now!--it will be there
all the night!


OSCAR

     'Room for one more. 'No, that one. Who's overboard! No one go overboard!
What's the odds? And I'm one of them? It's only this near-whipping to which I
object. Am I not overwhelmed? Their associations outlive all others. in one.
Where's the other one? I have obliged to do it. Which one was it? Here was her
opportunity. Why had it not occurred to her before? Is that an offer? The old
one. It is Original. not what ought they to be. Oh, such oxygen as we inhale!
Others. Others. Others. Others. Others. Others. Others. Others. Any objections?
My orders go--if there's no objections.
     Onistah offered his hand. This had to be fought out one to one. It was not
overwhelming. Oh, she's yours, is she? Oh, that's it? Oh, was that all? Oh,
where is he? Oh, why wasn't I there? What, Olympia! O Olympia! I have others!
Oh, if Olympia were here! O Olympia. The Observer, No. He was offered one of the
posts. Oxon. It was very old, very oily. Is that the one? It was very old, very
oily. Is that the one? The old one. Och! Och! That--oh! Och! Och! Och! Och! Och!
Och!
     Och! Och! Och! Och! Och! Och! Och! Och! Och! Oh, what? Oh, that old
statue! Oh, who? Where are the others? And oh! Not that--Oh! And oh! One chair
was overturned. They's others. And, outside of me, you're the only one that
does! It's just the opposite. Oh, it's you, is it? Why have you---- Oh, don't,
don't! Such an opportunity soon occurred. Oracles often equivocal and obscure.
And how old are you? How old is she? Oh I will. How old is he? You are so old
now. That was obedience.
     Just as it ought to be! Oh, no; why should there be? Have you any opening
here? And how old are you? How old is she? Oh I will. How old is he? You are so
old now. That was obedience. Just as it ought to be! Oh, no; why should there
be? Have you any opening here? You have others. They are overtaxed, and no one
cares. Old, he muttered, old! How old? You have others. They are overtaxed, and
no one cares. Old, he muttered, old! How old? was obstinate. It is clear and
orderly in its organization. Have you any opinion? A will was open to serious
objections. Onions? he observed. demanded one of the others. Is any one in
there? Can you open it? Is he very-- Objectionable?


PAPA

     And why not, pray? In Paris, where he was with fellow-exiles. Perhaps I
was; that remains to be proved. Peacock! Perhaps so; and perhaps not. These are
poets, philosophers, discoverers. Where is Pennington? Pennington. You'll be
hammered to a pulp, Pen. Is that here at Plymouth? Pennington pondered uneasily.
Here's the very proposition. Pound! This question is purely personal--just
between ourselves. that poor, pale face! She is a privileged personage. More I
will not promise. I pray you to let it pass. Who's Plato? Philadelphia: Childs &
Peterson. Will you have to put in a new piece? What is that place? These
mountain people are peculiar. Why, Pap! He favours my people, the Passmores. The
patent! piped Lissy from the porch. We were just mentioning my pestilent cotton-
mill projects. He was not pleased. He was in pain all over.
     You picked the flower on the plant? The puppy was presented, and yawned.
The party kept on about the place. It was a phenomenon. I was for the pirates.
But she passed her plate. What proofs-- She stopped, puzzled. My own profit!
That is not a pleasant position for me to find myself in. Is that what it is,
papa? She was as primitive as pollen. He hadn't the proofs. But Bobby was
plainly not playing up. What about my pride? he put it to them. Dr. ALEXANDER
PLASTERWELL is pastor. And now, then, for the Pole! To Politicians. Politics,
too. Mr. PUNCH is talked of to preside. With pleasure. proof. It doesn't pay.
for there is now no such place. Such is Paradise. Property can be paid for; the
lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be. He was in Paris. They were put
there. It was a plain prelude to war. At this point Great Britain passed from
the position of general peacemaker to that of a principal.
     The plight of most of the refugees is pitiable. They are prepared now to
do so. Private property will be absolutely respected and provisions paid for. It
is parricide! and now we are prisoners. By E. H. Pitcairn. But we can pay. I
have a plan to propose to you. I put it down. From a Painting by C.R. From a
Photograph. Property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people

proud, and liked praise. In this toil that rose-like person was all over
perspiration. There are points to be pleaded against this criticism. Pity is a
rebel passion. They have no pain, they ponder not Their own wrong. And passeth

criticism.
     Pity is a rebel passion. They have no pain, they ponder not Their own
wrong. And passeth on! below, p. above, on p. The buffalo-hunter passed that
point. Ploughin' around over the plains. She was proud, passionate, high-
spirited. We'll pass that point. That's what you're paid for. For what purpose?
But please yourself about that. You can peel the potatoes if you like. At once
he put the buck out of its pain. Very pretty. Tell me your plans, now you've
been promoted. You'd be proud of him. It is his passion. He paused again. Then
there is a pause. Had he been promoted on the battle-field? they were your own
people. How do you prove that? How providential! Passionately. Who were they--
what were they planning? Possibly, general, possibly. But you are the commander-
in-chief, Mr. President. He had passed away painlessly. What, pray?
     But now, Polly, about yourself. But he can not attend his patient if you
are present. Perhaps I can as it is. It was you who plotted it. I'll prepare
them. Now, be prudent. It is I that should be pitied here. What are your plans?
That's the place for you. Perhaps you were then, papa. I can prevent it!
Preposterous! we have both been punished! To MR. PERKINS. Here was one of his
peculiar prejudices. 'To MR. PERKINS. Pray for me. 'They are more pious.' 'To

she? This poem is printed in the Ann. he persisted. I-- Why did he pause? Very
pleasant. And that proved? He was puzzled. Please! Please!
     But she was past the point of caution. There was this peculiarity about
the Pedlar. You have to protect your patrons from insult. Perhaps, you pity him;
I cannot tell. I have no pity for them. she pleaded. And I pitied her. Pretty
again. she pleaded. I have a certain position in these parts. You have your own
pride; you have your own position here in The Corner. What's pity? They were
both pale now. I placed it all before him. His pride is the pride of the fiend.
What a party! What a party he's had! Too proud to do it. We'll put you in his
place. Was he, too, a party to the murderous plan? Who put it there? What power
then? And as she passed them. he persisted. I-- Why did he pause? Very pleasant.
And that proved? He was puzzled. Please! Please!

plainly not playing up. What about my pride? he put it to them. Proceed. It's a
plinthiful place it is, is this very manor. Who were your proprietors? What's
this?--a purse! Is that possible! Perhaps not, after all. And what is that
paper? he's a precious poor'atin'! By what means did you pass the palisades? He
was in the dark, and had not pen or paper! Push up--push up. They have not
perish'd--no! Have you paper and pencil? Plenty. she pleaded. It--it's playing
the piano! Then what made the piano play? This is Mr. Rat, the piano player.
It's too precious. Chance played its part.
     Prophet! It was not published. I' the pouts? pettishly. Good-night,
Politian. after a pause. Perfectly. Be not too positive. What is Poetry?--
Poetry! But at this point our mathematicians paused. At what point? All my
perceptions were purely sensual. it was pitiful! Pull it up! Mightn't you be a
partner of Pete's? It puzzled him. They're all piled down there. It was a part
of him. A pet out of him? I promise you that! It had its pleasures as well as
its pains. She proceeded gradually to her point. But in the past? Promotion! Why
not put in there? What place is it? It's the place where we keep peace. Are you
the prisident? Can that be possible? What proofs have you?
     Did they not pay you? Was he not promoted? In peace. Perhaps they have
some other plan. What is the promise? Who pulled her out? Perhaps he will be a
fine playmate for me. And there were oranges, and peaches, and pears! They were
all patricians. Were you personally present, Phaedo, with Socrates on that day
when he drank the poison in prison? Ech. But who were present, Phaedo? Upon this
some plaudits were heard, but very feeble, because they proceeded only from
persons placed there on purpose. The praise was ill-deserved. The proofs of the
other three are partly philological and partly historical. But it is past! Peace
between Rome and Parthia. Principal phenomena in dreaming. to what purpose
should that be? They proceed no further. The Priestess was to be a pure virgin.
Their path. Physic, part II. In peace. But they are seldom of the parlor
pattern. Here on the piazza, and with your flat-iron! There was a pause.
J-James, put Ch-Charlotte down. There was a pause. Who that has been on the
Pampas but can picture to himself this party as it left the little mud-hut on
the plain? The phrase organized the party.
     It was painful to her to talk with any person. Tell me, in plain prose,
the how and the why. His profile was the counterpart of that in the painting. In
the parlor. These little places don't pay. Will it do if it isn't a pitcher?
Will you have to pay for it? But, have you promised? Now, one more promise in
payment. It was not half as pretty as the pitcher. Not Prudie or Prue any more.
Both in perfect preservation. Do people? I have a plan to propose to her by and
by. That's the point. Will has a prize. Perhaps so. Miss Prudence, is it so
about praying, too? she pleaded. I have planned it all. she pleaded. she
persisted. She was very proud of showing my papa. And the pilot, they had such a
funny pilot! I'll put on plates for two more. She herself was a pusher. But I
prefer not to. Perhaps it oughtn't to be--if it is proud. In the parlor. These
little places don't pay.

if it is proud. Who put me into it? she pleaded. But Paul had not. Possibly. The
princess? Which prince? It is such a pity to pauperize the people.
     It is the prince. Paul put on this coat. How--how is Paul? Paul, what did
you do this for? Not particularly, answered Paul. Precisely. What place? I have
tried to put it into practice. A proof! Now, what is he doing in Petersburg? It
was all very princely and gorgeous and Parisian. Perhaps you are interested in
the peasants? Presently she passed him again. Probably. Now about the past.
Where is Paul? He paused. Paul looked pleased. Precisely. She was a princess!
Prove it. I paid a fabulous price for the papers. Perfectly! Precisely. And your
price? With pleasure. Princes, profane one! Paul is the same. You will profit by
them. Perhaps he has told you, princess.
     He is not our prince. Perhaps the princess will see me. Precisely. Prove
it! Where is the princess? They are his own people. Was it not my privilege? how
pleasant that was! You are a prince, and all-powerful in your own province. We
have been proud of our princesses--up to now. The knowledge was part of her
punishment. But is that so, Pavlo? Now, if it had been Paris---- But it cannot
be, interrupted Paul. They probably mistook him for the prince. Who put me into
it? What do you propose doing? she pleaded. But Paul had not. Possibly. The
princess? Which prince? It is such a pity to pauperize the people. It is the
prince. Paul put on this coat. How--how is Paul? Paul, what did you do this for?
Not particularly, answered Paul. Precisely. What place? I have tried to put it
into practice.
     A proof! Now, what is he doing in Petersburg? It was all very princely and
gorgeous and Parisian. Perhaps you are interested in the peasants? Presently she
passed him again. Probably. Now about the past. Where is Paul? He paused.
Precisely. She was a princess! Prove it. I paid a fabulous price for the papers.
Perfectly! Precisely. And your price? With pleasure. Princes, profane one! Paul
is the same. You will profit by them. Perhaps he has told you, princess. He is
not our prince. Perhaps the princess will see me. Precisely. Prove it! Where is
the princess? They are his own people. Was it not my privilege? how pleasant
that was! You are a prince, and all-powerful in your own province.
     We have been proud of our princesses--up to now. The knowledge was part of
her punishment. But is that so, Pavlo? Now, if it had been Paris---- But it
cannot be, interrupted Paul. They probably mistook him for the prince. The will
of those who broke the peace prevailed. The Palestine G.H.Q. To such perfection
did the R.F.C. M'Call, Brigadier-General Pollak. Palin, Major-General. The will

poems? Plenty--plenty! she put in, with a reminiscence of Major-General Punnit.
But then-- he paused. It was his only plea. It's all personal with you. Being
part of our property as it is. He paid no heed to her protest. And what
prospects has he now, or here? I'm progressive, that's what. What's the
programme for to-day? Perhaps, but we can't promise. Why, it's Pet Peters! you
were pushed in? where did I put it? Possibly I can. So, after all, Will's
persistency won out. Did you, Painswick? I proposed to her there. The police are
here now. What did it portend?


QUEBEC

     What's the question? Quick! They didn't quarrel--they didn't! she
questioned herself. It is quarter to! Query. Quality is lost in quantity. Quick!
Quick! Quick! quoth he. quoth he. quoth he. quoth he. quoth he. quoth he. quoth
he. Alack-a-daisy, me, quoth he. This is no' your quarrel. You--you and he
haven't had any--quarrel? There is a lull in the quarter they have just quit.
Quick! Quick! It is quarter to! That is my question. So they quit. Why should
they quarrel over that? Quick! Quick! he questioned.


ROMEO

is the same. Where are the rest? How ridiculous! And read them? Do you remember
it? is it really you? Really, ma'am? room for all!' In 't rood! It is the same
with his rival, who also recalls and recombines. Lip-advocacy only rouses lip-
homage. Ratey. Not as a rule. Right! Just after recall. Ready! Rather! Is all
right with you? that he rather repels me. Are you ready? he roared. he returned.
Well, I reckon you're about right. I reckon you will. I do--you're right. Do you
remember? he repeated.
     Do you reckon she is? he roared. I really haven't the heart to reprove
her. Was that right? he repeated. he repeated. I'll be all right. That's right,
quavered Roxy. Roasting retains it. You did that all right. Rest in there. She
rocked. Now it's all over both ruffles. He regarded her. she did not reply. He
rose. He roved about the room. He regarded her. They gathered for My Rock, My

road to--? 'You are right,' he rejoined, 'and I thank you. and, Who will
recognize me? The Russians didn't have our range. he replied. On Wednesday it
was relieved and retired to the rear. But the Turks ran and the ridge was ours.
I am ready to listen, I replied. You are right, he replied. Why don't you have
it removed? That is the reason it cannot be removed. All right, I replied. She
followed him from room to room. We retired as usual to rest. He will recover
now. This room is really the tea-room for the Royal ladies when in residence. I
replied. I repeated. What was the reason of this demonstration of respect? you
will be all but ruined! You remember her? He was as revengeful as a Red Indian.
A receipt, and from him too! A receipt, and from him too! The Russians didn't
have our range. he replied. On Wednesday it was relieved and retired to the

     He read me the recipe, while I compounded it. He then remembered me at
once. He replied, O demon-faced! Raise her again! Why raise me any more? Raise
her again! Why raise me any more? The rain! roared Robin at last. But Robin was
ready for any happening. Why, how now, Robin! All right. His hand reached for a
revolver. he roared. Righto. Against the regulations. Will you be responsible
for him? There was Rhinegoldt now. No, I don't reckon I will. It was rum. he
roared. I reckon she is. What's your rush? Be reasonable. It's all right now.
What was the real reason he didn't come? All right. To the right! he roared. I
reckon I was too pre-emtory.
     I'm all right. I'll do the rest. I have another reason too, he replied. By
nature she was of the ruling race. Most of his race are. Righto! All right.
Righto. But it was real. I'll be all right. Of my rival? Is he your rival? On to
Richmond! But we have some rights. And the rumors! He is on the rebel rear. They
rush through them, over them. It's all over--we are ruined! You are from
Richmond? No treason in Rosedale, remember! Have you read it? If they were all
right, why should they do that? But the red rose is my favorite. Where are the
ropes? The rebels had relieved him of that at Bull Run. Now they are in the
room. He ran out. The white rose is red now, Rosa. There is really no reason for
my remaining here, now that you are well. That's all right.
     You are right. is it really you? This she resolved to do. He had received
no reply. Read that? In other respects I have no reason to complain. What is not

represent? She rose and crossed the room. It is a revelation. repeated he.

these Russians. You remember that, do you? Your record is against you. I read it
there, and she saw me reading. What do you recommend? He has organized a regular

returned to her. No, she replied. He was raising his rifle again. he repeated.
And rumor grew into rumor. It was raised again. When he returned he brought a
rabbit. They had few rivals. Do you remember? --Rue Saint-Hyacinthe-Saint-

SIERRA

     Sweethearts? Just what I say. said Polly, softly. A story? what shall I
do! What shall you do if it does not? Then I am satisfied. with a sympathetic
sigh. I shall long to see you. says Kitty, with a shiver. 'In the street.' I
will save you. I am strong now. But, Nell, it is splendid, and what shall I do
about it? Keep silent and I shall soon be with you. Better be silly now than
sorry by and by. But I was too late, it seems; you have suffered, to my sorrow.
And he said he was not? Can you will to see it? Who has said stupidities to you,
that you doubt me? I say 'it cannot be.' I have been very selfish. Did he speak
the truth when he said he was not? she said, sharply. Aren't you sorry? Shot off
as slick as a whistle. said the spirit. They are silent on all that they have
really seen for themselves. She sees what the children do not, or cannot see. He
has seen it, and we see it with his eyes.
     Speak for yourself and from yourself, or be silent. No Style can be good
that is not slncere. And thus it stands with Style. But Sincerity will save us.
Such had been the storekeeper's careful statement. Me no sabby, sulked the
Chinaman. Why, see here, this is the police station! Can't you suggest
something? queried the ship's surgeon. So I am--be sure of it. I will amend my
statement by saying that I will send a second to see you. All your sympathies?
On shore, at some point to be selected by the seconds? Say, but we're slackening
speed! sounded sharply overhead. H'assuredly, sir. The door shook and shivered.
he shouted. You have a lot of slang, then, I suppose. I'd suspect, at least, if
he had a sweetheart. Both stepped to toe the scratch. Steady, now! Just what I
said. Stearns, you surely don't mean that? Surely! But I shall be glad to see
what you have to show me. I have, said Belle sweetly. But in other subjects he
was somewhat above the minimum. I swear! 'Deed and truth, Sur, they is cinder-
heaps and slag from the iron-works, Sur; and yon is Merthyr-Tydvil, sure.
     Now see what I am. She was silent. But he cannot be sure. As he spoke, our
carriage stopped. He has a special horror of sunshine. Suppose it should be some
infernal-machine. Seeing no Plato, but only some sawdust, they grew still more
suspicious. What shall she do? what shall she do? What did he say then? Shade
stopped immediately for that. It's on a strike again. Sunday's over at sundown.
I'll show her whar she's to sleep at, after while. You set down. Why Sunday? I
saw just three there by the spring. Stoddard shook his head. I love to do it,
she said simply. Then you shove your shifting lever--see, here it is--over to
the next speed. I'm sure proud to be here with you-all, she said. Isn't that the
girl Mr. Stoddard was speaking to me about? It sure was that, sighed Johnnie.
Sessions says they'll raise me again soon. He spoke over his shoulder to her.
Stoddard glanced at her in surprise. Why should you say that? I am not sure that
it would be suitable if they did. Shut up--will you? She sets a heap of store by
what I say.
     You're a-aimin' to steal it from her. He was scarcely sane at the moment.
Why, I made shore they was silver. And you say he fell down the steps? Was ma
sick? You're as spick and span as a bride. Then I think I shall, said Stoddard
with sudden resolution. He said no more. Stoddard shook his head. I'm sorry, he
said at last. See what he's got to say. Shade--Shade Buckheath! What's that you
say? It seems they sent for her over to Mr. Hardwickses where she was at.
growled Shade sulkily. Can you stop it? You see that, don't you? Since? What did
he say? He smiled a little as he said it. The Scotchman shook his head. Don't
worry any more, I'll see about this, somehow. He shook the stranger savagely.
You're that sort. Why, what Shade said himself. He was here, she said in a sort
of aside. she sobbed. After a little silence he spoke again. That first
scrimmage showed me just what the men were after, Stoddard said. He seldom spoke
as a man speaks who has something to say, but as a man who makes something to
say.
     What can be supplied? he said to this. No, she said. He straightened. He
has, she said. Here, she said. She slurred the rest, until the y sound squinted
in. she screamed, and shook her straight hair. I'd smother. They did speak. They
started. He had stayed. She was silent. To a show. said Bobby, still
subjunctive. I started to and then somebody always said something, said Lulu
humbly. Then they'll simmer down. Why not say the wedding service? he said, and
sat down again. Sure I'm serious. Say, he said, you come on with me. We'll have
it done over again somewhere, if you say so. She sat silent, frowning, put-upon.
See--where were they then? She sprang up. But he isn't sure. And I had to be
sure. she said. But you see for yourself. But you say he's still my husband.
     Say, but we were surprised! Say, why don't you send it to his brother?
They had all stopped. What did they say? She set all before him and stood by
him. Lulie, she said, Set down. But then he sneered. And he saw. I saw, said
Dwight, I saw she wasn't herself. she supposed. I see, said Cornish, and said
what he had been waiting to say: That he too had been in Savannah, Georgia. she
said. she said. I see, said Cornish. We were in Savannah, Georgia, she said. I
was sitting the same as there. What'd he say? But when all this had spent
itself, what was she herself to do? Down the sidewalk. Sure she did, said Lenny.
Why had she not stayed in Warbleton and asked the sheriff or somebody--no, not
the sheriff. And she saw that this sounded as if she were talking about a tea-
party. Who said he's here? But, Silly! she said, and swallowed. He had, he said,
something to see to there in Millton. Stay here. No, she said. She stood staring
after him. You see that, don't you?
     See that? They stared at her. Well, that settles---- She said no more. My
sweet, self-sacrificing sister, she murmured. But all that he said was: Good-
bye. He stood staring out the window. Oh, she said, you--you---- There's only
this about that, said he. She said: I wanted somebody of my own. No, Cornish
said soberly. I'm not surprised, after all, he said. she said. All sizes and
styles. very small. Secondly. Or say, rather, a Sun. how splendid--how splendid!
It must be the Spring Season there! No fresh subjects to be had, you say? The
POPE is said to be out of Spirits. Sit down. I saw her sweet lip quiver, As he
started for the store. That is to say--- something pun-ny. Why, sure. Something
wrong with the spark. The spark,--is it there? I have not seen her since we were
at school. it is still a savory recollection. Straw Hat.--Not I, upon my soul!
Straw Hat.--What! Straw Hat.--Breach of something!
     The shadow of man is solitude. It was his business to shoot, and be shot.
what a scene! Shakespeare is pre-eminent; Spencer is music. Where shall I be
then? There we should have stopped. We have no selfish ends to serve. She swayed
for a second. They seemed to be stupefied. I started for them and soon caught up
with them. Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen stood shoulder to shoulder. The
Germans were seemingly surrounded and cut off and were summoned to surrender.
Still, the short glance had been sufficient to see what was going on. Stop! It
was the saddest sight I ever saw. It seems impossible to suffer more. Nothing
seems to stop them. We had just been having our own imaginations stimulated on
the subject of shells striking. I submerged at once. After six reports there was
again silence save for the whirr of shells as they sang up the small valley. I
shot so slowly,.so very slowly. Of such is the grim story of Senlis. What a
spectacle it was! The pile of stuff was still smoldering. The slaughter on both
sides was considerable. It was all very simple. No; side by side they were seen
to sit down. Our shells! The enemy sprang no surprises. Then we heard your
soldiers shouting.
     But success did not stop here. It is mid-winter now, said Lady Studley.
What have you said about me to Sir Henry? I suspect! Why do you stay here? What
are her symptoms? My sleep is of short duration. Now speak, he said. This is my
story, I said. Stoop down. He said no more. I went on scouring my double-handed
sword. A splendid purchase, you'll see. That will save something. So they
started. Shall we settle her? Is it not best to be on the safe side? Here are
some of the specimens. During the time-interval between the signatures shown in
Nos. What was it she saw? You can sell her, too. We have no selfish ends to
serve. She swayed for a second. They seemed to be stupefied. I started for them
and soon caught up with them. Englishmen, Irishmen and Scotsmen stood shoulder
to shoulder. The Germans were seemingly surrounded and cut off and were summoned

grassed over, but there were no sidewalks. said both of them. The papers which I
had were in the saddlebag safe. I saw at once he was a rebel soldier. A soldier
standing by said: Oh! Then, as soon as filled, they are sealed up. of what
utility are the servants of the state? how can I speak? After saluting me, he
sat down by me. On seeing such a scene and such splendid preparations, my senses
were bewildered. O God, said I what shall I now do? He said to me, 'Bring him
with you.'
     I summoned them before me. I smiled, and said, O fool! They were silent.
Now, if Thou savest, I am saved.' She smiled and remained silent. Such was my
state, and such was hers! Strophe I. The ships, the ships awaken! She is singing
softly to herself and does not see the Herald or the scene before her.
CASSANDRA. Why should I speak the shame of them, before They come?. And my sons?
Sing sorrow. HEC. My sorrow!. I shall do service in the hall Of them that slew.
How? How shall it be? Strophe I. Strophe. --See above. In the other Stesichorus,

sly am I, too. Stand back, Sheriff! shouted Will Stutely after the Sheriff. Step
up! Step up! Stop! and fall straightway into a swoon. So saying, he drew his
sword. Stop! Stop! Share and share alike. cried he, smiting Will Scarlet. But
what a sight was that which they saw! And stay, good Stutely. Then out spake
Will Scarlet boldly. Then up spoke Will Scarlet. She is as soft and gentle as a
stockdove. Suddenly he straightened up. Is it sooth? Then up spake Will Scarlet.
snarled the other. said she. said he sternly. Here he stopped of a sudden, for
he thought that he heard the sound of someone in sorrow. Why, this, said the
Sheriff.
     said he sternly. The axe-head swung in a half-circle. Did he send you to
smash our whiskey-barrels? The question struck a spark of spirit from her. Stand
back, sir. You smashed my whiskey-barrels? It was a test of sheer strength. I
can see that. Now he was in a state of continual sullen ill-temper. Something
had frightened them and they were on a stampede. Soon now, Morse shouted to
Stearns. Not soldiers, are they? West snorted scornfully. I was in the store
myself. They'll be here soon. I too thank you, she said stiffly. Now there were
six. Not for the smuggler. Not too strong. Now you're shoutin, C.N. Scared, are
you? Seems to be. stock would shoot down. he asked swiftly, between sentences.
Still they said nothing. It'll be just as you say. But not to stay down. She
shivered. She stopped. I don't see her here to-night.
     He shrugged his shoulders insolently. Then--a shrill scream for help! She
screamed. I'll not stand for that. He's no' at the store. He was smiling. His
sunny smile was disarming. There had been a struggle. When I say 'Come!' The sun
would sink shortly. Save me from him! West stopped in his stride. His slow brain
stalled. He was still sitting on the stool. What was there to say? His eyes were
shining strangely. He shrugged his shoulders. Too stormy. Silence became too
significant. Whaley shrugged his shoulders. Shoot him down. He lifted his
shoulders in a shrug. She slept long and soundly. Where your snowshoes? Then you
send him here. They were heavy with snow which had not been shaken from them.
The tree-dweller slid down and stood before him. We'll see about that. We'll see
about that. She stopped, enough said.
     We saw stains in the snow. Shot in the side and in the thigh. The soldier
smiled grimly. She stared. All Faraway was out to see the start. When they
talked, it was because they had something to say. No more slops, he said. See
Makoye-kin--and his squaw. The sister of Stokimatis was my mother. He was
sentimental. I'll starve if I have to. I'll say that for him. His hand shot
straight out. He stared up out of sightless eyes. His safety depended on their
safety. Beresford was a sorry sight. The soldier's head sank down. I swear I
will. That's what you're sent for. See what I can do, sir. The slot pointed
south. Stearns! Six o'clock sharp. But let's stick to the subject. It's a
subject I can do only slight justice. Since when? Why do you say that? I don't
see him. what shall we do? What shall I do?--O Polly, what shall we do?
     What shall we do? Don't be too sure of that. Be serious. These swarmed
about him. Will ye all swear secrecy? You shall have the twenty-one shillings in
the shinplasters of the republic. Steady, men, steady! The President smiled
sadly. He spoke in sincere contrition. Suppose we can sell 'em in Richmond? He
raised himself slowly and seized it. I---- There, there--stop. she screamed,
starting up--where is he? Don't be too sure of that. There, do you see? What we
don't sell to you we'll send to England. Where shall it be? That's square. Is
the skiff here? She was at his side. Were they soldiers? How does that strike
you? Here they were secure. Six, with you and me. All was silent. I'm surprised
at such selfish ingratitude. There's the Southerner through and through in that
sentimentality. When it is settled by the sword we shall be satisfied. You can
stow them about you easily, they are so small. I haven't seen him while we have
been out.
     What shall we do if he has? He is in his own room and secure from
surprise. Then silence. What's that sound? There are a score of them! But I have
seen you somewhere. Secrete them. What should he say? stand still, what's that?
Down on your stomachs. He shrinks into shadow against the oak at this
suggestion; snakes? He is smothering. My son! He is a soldier. The hissing
snakes have sunk into it. There, see that! I can not stay here. Then suppose we
reached the spot? There was, however, something more startling. Now we must be
slippery as snakes. If they are, we shall soon hear them. You mean my sense is
small? All was silent. Now, do be silent. Have they swords? You are surrounded!
Sing out! He led them swiftly and surely, and why shouldn't he? Straight. That
surprises me.
     How can I say what a mother should say? My only son! My son shot Wesley! O
Mrs. Sprague, think what you are saying! I say shoot them. Merry, too, had seen
the story, and came over to show it to Mrs. Sprague. She shuddered. I have just
been at the Spragues. I shall come and see you all soon. I shall not. Can I see
him? What should she say? Where shall you be? Whom was she about to see? Stop
where you are. Suppose you read me something? What shall it be? I shall go at
once to the Spragues. Stop! I suppose you are with the Spragues? The South is
sure to be beaten. She started. 'Early, Sir?' You have set him, that I might
shoot him: but I have not shot him.' He smiled. 'I am sure said she they have
affected me.' They are satisfied; they have seen enough of me.' I am, Sir, Your
most humble servant, SAM. 'I am, Sir, 'Your most humble servant, 'SAM. 'I am,
Sir, 'Your most humble servant, 'SAM.
     'I am, Sir, 'Your humble servant, 'SAM. He had not a word to say, Sir.'
No, Sir, said the other, I have not that advantage. 'No, Sir. 'No, Sir. 'No,
Sir.' 'How so, Sir?' 'That is system, Sir. 'No, Sir: it is a sheet, no matter of
what.' 'Yes, Sir, it is. 'Why, Sir, not sensible in that respect. 'I am, Sir,
'Your most humble servant, 'SAM. Why do you speak here? I am, Sir, Your most
humble servant, SAM. I am, Sincerely yours, SAM. We shall now see what air will
do. I shall be glad to see her again. 'I am, Sir, 'Your most humble servant,
'SAM. 'I am, Sir, 'Your most humble servant, 'SAM. had you them all to yourself,
Sir?' 'I am pleased Sir, to be sure. He said, 'They were right, Sir.' You see
they'd have fitted him to a T,' smiling. No, Sir, it is not.' 'It is, Sir.'
'This is all sophisticated. When I am settled, I shall write again. But what can
a sick man say, but that he is sick? But all this is now superfluous. 'I am,
Sir, 'Your humble servant, 'SAM.
     'I am, Sir, 'Your most humble servant, 'SAM. He was somewhat susceptible
of flattery. 'I am, Sir, 'Your most humble servant, 'SAM. 'Swift,' he says,
'washed himself with oriental scrupulosity.' Spectator, No. to Sat. I have sent
Stepney's Epitaph. See several more in The Gent. What is it you have to say
against it? The Spectator, No. 'Nine,' he said, 'you are a Sunday Woman.' A
considerable sum had already been swallowed up in the South Sea.' Come sometimes
and see, Sir, 'Your humble servant, 'SAM. I said I was. Spectator, No. He
smiled, and replied, 'I surely will.' It was all straight. I started talking to
Suds. he says. It sure was on his shoulder; Donnegan. Sure it was. Still no sign
of life. I am sorry. He smiled at her. I'm sorry. In my service. You shall see
the steps by which I judged you. Donnegan shrugged his shoulders. Not once did
he speak until he saw that all was well. Whom should I select?
     He sent me the souvenir, but that was all. Is that the scheme? he
suggested. Sit down. Then I suppose you're safe enough. Keep straight on, he
said. Steady! Both shacks or none at all, said the spokesman. Say which? Ain't
you seen that sign? he shouted. Did you see him smile over it? Do they say that?
You silly! That smile stopped the posse. He's sleepin' soun' an' fas'. He's
superb! Then stay, stay! She did not speak. He was; and he was more than that,
if there be a stronger superlative. Stop him! A shootin' scrape here! That's why
I'm speaking to you. And you, said Donnegan, are a scoundrel. I shall not. But
you shot him down! she said. See how people stare at me! You have said several.
Ah, don't you see I'm serious?
     she said. I shouldn't have said that. You shall see. There was a swift
scuffle, very soft of movement. She shrugged her shoulders. For your own sake.
He stood up. And silly. Under the surface I am as serious as fire. Do you see
nothing serious about me? And I am sorry. Say that again! I'll have to start all
over again. Donnegan stopped short. But now, sit down. Sentiment, I say, silly
sentiment. And I'm sorry for it. They remained silent, staring at each other. he
said softly. You shall see. Not a scratch. She was sunk in a brown study. I have
spoken with him. With the sheriff. Do what you want, he said suddenly. His eyes
were sunken in shadow. Why the sudden silence? He lied with the smoothness of
silk. Suspicious? I was sick of it.
     It isn't safe for me to stay here. Did you see them? She had to submit
when he swept her into his arms. This is for my sins. he said sharply. I'll stay
here; I haven't much to say. I can do better still, he said, smiling. I'm safe
with you, said the girl. How small it was, and how sinister! Others seemed to
have sensed the meaning of this silent scene. and saw him stride forward. It was
all straight. I started talking to Suds. It sure was on his shoulder; Donnegan.
Sure it was. Still no sign of life. He smiled at her. I'm sorry. In my service.
You shall see the steps by which I judged you. Donnegan shrugged his shoulders.
Not once did he speak until he saw that all was well. Whom should I select? He

scrape here! That's why I'm speaking to you. And you, said Donnegan, are a
scoundrel. I shall not. But you shot him down! she said. Did you send for me?
See how people stare at me! You have said several. Ah, don't you see I'm
serious? she said. I shouldn't have said that. You shall see. There was a swift
scuffle, very soft of movement. She shrugged her shoulders. For your own sake.
He stood up. And silly.
     Under the surface I am as serious as fire. Do you see nothing serious

can do better still, he said, smiling. How small it was, and how sinister!
Others seemed to have sensed the meaning of this silent scene. and saw him
stride forward.
     He seldom spoke as a man speaks who has something to say, but as a man who
makes something to say. What can be supplied? he said to this. He saw it now.
No, she said. He straightened. He has, she said. Here, she said. She slurred the
rest, until the y sound squinted in. she screamed, and shook her straight hair.
I'd smother. They did speak. They started. He had stayed. She was silent. To a
show. said Bobby, still subjunctive. I started to and then somebody always said
something, said Lulu humbly. Then they'll simmer down. Why not say the wedding
service? he said, and sat down again. Sure I'm serious. Say, he said, you come
on with me. We'll have it done over again somewhere, if you say so. She sat
silent, frowning, put-upon. See--where were they then? She sprang up. But he
isn't sure. And I had to be sure. she said.
     But you see for yourself. But you say he's still my husband. Say, but we
were surprised! Say, why don't you send it to his brother? They had all stopped.
What did they say? She set all before him and stood by him. Lulie, she said, Set
down. But then he sneered. I saw, said Dwight, I saw she wasn't herself. she
supposed. I see, said Cornish, and said what he had been waiting to say: That he
too had been in Savannah, Georgia. she said. He said ba-ird. she said. And so
you shall. I see, said Cornish. We were in Savannah, Georgia, she said. I was
sitting the same as there. What'd he say? But when all this had spent itself,
what was she herself to do? Down the sidewalk. Sure she did, said Lenny. Why had
she not stayed in Warbleton and asked the sheriff or somebody--no, not the
sheriff. And she saw that this sounded as if she were talking about a tea-party.
Who said he's here? But, Silly! she said, and swallowed. He had, he said,
something to see to there in Millton. Stay here.
     No, she said. She stood staring after him. You see that, don't you? See
that? They stared at her. Well, that settles---- She said no more. My sweet,
self-sacrificing sister, she murmured. But all that he said was: Good-bye. He
stood staring out the window. See, she said. Oh, she said, you--you---- There's
only this about that, said he. She said: I wanted somebody of my own. No,
Cornish said soberly. I'm not surprised, after all, he said. Mrs. Seba Smith. To
be sure. said Nick, sarcastically. Which side of him? We shall have venison, in
the season. Speak, then; what have you to say? Not a syllable. Beulah--my sister
--my own sister! What he say, he do. But, no more was said. There is a stranger!
Six--two--seven t'ousand. Save he scalp, too. And now 'tis still! Why do I say
this? are you shut out by this sudden inroad?
     But are we safe on this seat?--May we not be seen by the Indians, since we
so plainly see them? I am sorry for it. Are they not in their war-paint, sir? I
see how it is, Willoughby--I see how it is. Is it not all seeming, sir? You saw
nothing of the savages? Still, she said nothing. This is strange! He did, and I
was at his side. What of that, sir! As soon as it was light, I did that myself,
sir. Each and all, sir. He's with the savages. We'll see to that, captain--we'll
see to that. But they say not. said Nick, sternly. Where your sentinel to stop
Injin? Mrs. Seba Smith. This is a most singular situation to be in! There is no
outlet of sufficient size. Still, the secret spring eluded her search. What says
he himself? Still it showed no signs of compunction. Do you see the signs of
this? No, he said; squaw quit cap'in, now. Short as had been the struggle, the
thirst for scalps had led some of the savages to this sanctuary. Here they
separated. We'll see about that. I'd just show her! School!
     I don't see how that helps me any--now, she said. Now what shall I do? I
should say it was! As soon as we can arrange it, I suppose. What was it you were
about to say? We do seem to be 'up against it,' as Ted says. All safe and sound,
she said. You see she had been here only once, said Billie. from the sufferer.
They had just started up the stairs when Violet cried out, her voice sounding
sharp in the stillness: What's that? D-do you suppose it was only a s-suitcase?
Then suddenly she sat up. she said, her eyes sparkling. You can't steal any of
our corn-growing secrets. Can't we sell some of this stuff? What shall we do to
'em? I'll stay down here awhile and see what I can see. Who was it that said
something or other was blind? Say, what are you doing up there? Shall we send
for the doctor? Now, she said, standing back and regarding her work with
satisfaction, we shall see what we shall see! Now I'm sure. Say, what shall I be
doin' with this? Of course not, silly, she said. You're so slow! Why was she so
slow? Is there a pin sticking you, or something? How silently serene a sea of
pride! Shew. But stay!
     There is a twofold Silence--sea and shore-- Body and soul. Did I sigh?
I'll see to it. I speak to him--he speaks of Lalage? 'Tis very strange! 'Tis
sworn! All is not still. V. The Suburbs. Now this is very strange! Shade of the
immortal Shakespeare! The solemn song be sung? The grass was short, springy,
sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. Sophocles--'Antig.' I say with a
sensual delight. It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. To-morrow we
will speak of this. Had she a sister? a steed! Here I say no, at once. He stood
suffering mutely under it. He came to a stop sharply. Stand up! Someday, he said
slowly, speaking entirely to himself. He shot me ag'in through the leg and
stopped me. Again the silence. He swept on with a lengthening stride. It
screamed above him. Sure he's been here, said the owner. The sheriff snorted.
They sat in at three-handed stud poker.
     And saying that he slopes out of the room. he sighed. Stand over yonder by
that stump. I see, he said, and swallowed with difficulty. Sure is some story!
It was him that sent me down! He says, 'Reeve shot up Bull. Then you can say
that Reeve started something--that you shot in self-defense. Sit down! I can
shoot straight. Stand up! It sort of soaks into your dreams. Pete said sharply.
Smashed? And you're supporting him? That shows how simple he is. That's the
stuff that's in him! What do they say? Stand still . it's me . it's Tod! I just
stopped in to see him. Shoot him? he suggested. Suppose you say what you want?
Sure I seen him, and he grinned. Suppose that? The saddle? Stay where you are!
he shouted. All he saw was the head of the stallion. And he saved your skin,
Dunbar.
     Shut up, snapped his master. I'm sorry for that. So it was settled. After
all, the scheme was a simple one. Suppose he's simply half-asleep? It's started,
he said. I'm sorry, he said. A yaller-hearted sneak! He stood swaying a little
from side to side. His shoes were too small. Stop, sir, I want you! Faith, sir,
it's a steamboat. A schooner sails to-morrow. asked the seasick Sukey. Can't you
sink the ship? Who is that shootin'? What is it shootin' at? darkness has
shrouded the sun! To be sure. Indeed I did sir, and do still! Say, what's that,
shipmate? And still a-coming? Now that's sensible. What is that, Sukey? I am
sorry for it. What show can he have? He didn't say this. Is this all you have to
say? Say something kind to me. Strip!
     What the d---l are you stopping for? Sukey was sullen and melancholy. Why
were you not at your station, sir? What station do you mean, sir? He was sober,
silent and melancholy. The suspense was short. That secret was too sacred. We'll
see about that! My Sukey's on t'other side. The shot we have been firing were
all too small. Sergeant Stevens, awake! Lieutenant-Colonel Short was among the
slain. We supposed you were with the soldiers and came after you. But no ship is
in sight. I suppose he is. Then I will serve under you. She said something about
her father. she sobbed. Then they stood silent. If heaven spares me, I shall.
She was serious now. She was silent. Still she was silent. Get the smelling
salts! Susan said by and by, I beg your pardon, what were you saying when I
started to sneeze? He got up and shook hands with him and said, How do you do,
sir, How do you do, sir! What do you suppose Snubby Nose did? She said, I have
been shopping all day. Bushy-Tail was surprised you may be sure. Susan said, He
does not seem to mind when we speak of noses!
     Susan Cotton-Tail sat down in the corner. Then the merry-go-round went
slower and slower, and slower, and finally stopped. Then they began to sail
slowly down, down, down. Can't you see I am starving? No sooner said than done.
He shook it again. He shook it again. He was surprised you may be sure. The
Circus Cotton-Tails stood still. --and so saying, stabbed her to the heart. But
in the spring of B.C. the sea! But why should I speak doubtfully about stealing?
He that falls, said he, will suffer the more. To me he seems to be so, said
Simmias. Does it not seem so to you? By no means, Socrates, said Simmias. Do
they not seem so to you? We say it is something, by Jupiter. Does it not seem so
to you? He said that he did not. They were about six thousand strong. The charge
was as successful as it was sudden. But she was surely made of sterner stuff.
Pompey sided with the senate. Sext. Sext. Their store of provisions was so small
that it sufficed only for the soldiery. Sext. Sertorius is assassinated in
Spain; the Spaniards submit to Pompey.
     The strength of Summer is of short continuance! Sect. Symbol: Saturn
Saturn, Saturday. Soul honey-sweet. The sign a ship. For Mr. Stepel to see it,
of course. said she. You started then at the idea: I saw you! She seemed
unusually strong. I think she silently said good-bye to them. We stood still to
listen. What, then, does the sailor sing?--and does he sing at all? Certainly
the sailor sings. But I found what the sailor does sing. But other songs the
sailor sings. The sailor does not lack for singing. These are some of the
working-songs of the sea. They are not chosen for their sense, but for their
sound. If the sea wants songs, it will have them. See!--see Mr.----But the sobs
were too frequent. The services of Sunday were finished. Your sympathy is as
deep as your sincerity. But 'tis uncomf'table for straight wood to be ker-corded
up with such ker-crooked sticks as him. Shod with the shoes of swiftness, we
have annihilated space and time. He has absolutely sunk out of sight. I am the
State!? You are saved! The sensation did not subside. If you had simply said,
'Yes,' it would have satisfied me. what a scene was there!
     He seemed to have stepped out of it. It is I who am the sufferer. I have
seen that before, said Dalton. There was no sound. Silence, darkness, still. Why
should it stand so high at the shoulders? It is a sort of ranger service. Hush,
--said I,--what will the divinity-student say? She had smiled in self-
confidence. To-morrow is Saturday! It's sure to have that, said her mother. Then
I don't see why-- said Marjorie. Stitch, stitch, stitch, would not seem
dreadful, at all. I don't see how. And wasn't there a story about the Seven
Sleepers? I have to be very severe with myself. But I suppose something will,
some day. Then I'd see to it that I did it. So do I, said Marjorie, spiritedly.
I set myself to reading and studying. I don't see how. Because I was silly, she
said emphatically. You see you are doing something for me. I'll show it to you.
Isn't that selfish? And what did he say? said the subdued, sad voice. It's all
sudden. Oh, the school studies! Father says I spoil them.
     You must be sure to stay to supper. Can you sing that? Was she a slave?
And you are sixteen, aren't you? Sometimes we do not speak for an hour. He
stayed there 'astonished' seven days. Are you sure of me, now? Shall I put it
under this stone so that you will have to stoop for it? Are you satisfied? To be
sure he has, said Marjorie. No, he said, smiling at her simplicity. You should
have seen her! Hasn't she spoken of them? He has been scolding me,--but that
would satisfy him. Then that is all he says. I'm sure I'm sorry, said Mrs.
Rheid. May I see up stairs, too? Marjorie, it's a snow storm. School? This is
such a surprise! Such a splendid surprise. No, she said. I shall have nothing to
strive for. when did you see them? There is no sorrow like this sorrow. I am
sure of it. Is he a sailor? She was as sure of it as I was. Oh, I'm so sorry, so
sorry! I will stay.
     Something de-licious. But was it not all selfishness, after all? I am more
sorry than you are. I can stand it if you can. We'll do it after school! Was it
such a very sad story then? you have said it. I will send her to your mother in
the spring. That is sad, said Prue. Wasn't he sorry? He was very sorry. He was
sorry, too. I don't think that is such a sad story. But I'm sorry. Both were
strangers to me. And the sunsets! Is it a secret? Not since I came in September.
Both, she said smiling. I suppose I shall leave school. I'll sing you to sleep
after supper. I suppose Morris has spoken for himself. It's the shock? What
shall I say to his mother? What do you see? The few words were solemnly spoken.
When were you satisfied? One more Sunday with you, sweetheart! You haven't had
any supper, Will! I never have sailed on Sunday.
     I have been in ships that did do it. Is that all we have to do with it--
submit to it? Has she said so? But see that sumach. Did you set the sponge for
the bread? He who sends the storm steers the vessel.--Rev. It was to be your
surprise, and now I've spoiled it. But I can, she said to herself. Suppose he
wants to see you. You seem to be undergoing some struggles now. That is why I
said it, she said archly. She had smiled in self-confidence. To-morrow is
Saturday! It's sure to have that, said her mother. Then I don't see why-- said
Marjorie. Stitch, stitch, stitch, would not seem dreadful, at all. I don't see
how. And wasn't there a story about the Seven Sleepers? I have to be very severe
with myself. But I suppose something will, some day. Then I'd see to it that I
did it. So do I, said Marjorie, spiritedly. I set myself to reading and
studying. I don't see how. Because I was silly, she said emphatically. You see
you are doing something for me. I'll show it to you. Isn't that selfish? And
what did he say? said the subdued, sad voice.
     It's all sudden. Oh, the school studies! Father says I spoil them. You

has, said Marjorie. No, he said, smiling at her simplicity. You should have seen
her! Hasn't she spoken of them? He has been scolding me,--but that would satisfy
him. Then that is all he says. I'm sure I'm sorry, said Mrs. Rheid. May I see up
stairs, too? Marjorie, it's a snow storm. School? This is such a surprise! Such
a splendid surprise. No, she said. I shall have nothing to strive for. when did
you see them? There is no sorrow like this sorrow. I am sure of it. Is he a
sailor?
     She was as sure of it as I was. Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry! I will stay.
Something de-licious. But was it not all selfishness, after all? I am more sorry
than you are. I can stand it if you can. We'll do it after school! Was it such a
very sad story then? I will send her to your mother in the spring. That is sad,
said Prue. Wasn't he sorry? He was very sorry. He was sorry, too. I don't think
that is such a sad story. But I'm sorry. Both were strangers to me. And the
sunsets! Is it a secret? Not since I came in September. Both, she said smiling.
I suppose I shall leave school. I suppose Morris has spoken for himself. It's

she said to herself. Suppose he wants to see you. You seem to be undergoing some
struggles now. That is why I said it, she said archly. Steinmetz shook his
shaggy head. He shrugged his shoulders and shivered. It has a saddle, said
Steinmetz at length. This man, he said, was starving. Steinmetz stooped down. I
don't see how they can stop us, he said. The Seine and the Thames--shallow--
shallow--shallow. That is to say, he was a sort of social revolver. I did not
expect to see you here, she said. She was of that school. Then she suppressed a
sigh--badly. The baron shrugged his shoulders. Will you not sit down? He was
surprised at his own sincerity. she asked, still smiling. She shrugged her
shoulders and waited. Good-night, he said shortly. There was a short silence.
     He believes it still, which is somewhat startling. See you later, he said.
But he did not say it. I am not very sure that it will be a success. She did not
speak at once. she said. said the starosta. You see something on the road? The
starosta, standing in his door-way, saw the smile. The sound was repeated, and
Steinmetz slowly rose from his seat. It is slow. Paul shrugged his shoulders.
The starosta struck a light. Paul shrugged his shoulders. Because she loves you,
he said shortly. I will send it off, he said. Quite suddenly she stopped. The
sun had just set. asked Steinmetz sharply. She shrugged her shoulders. Steinmetz
shook his head. she said. she said. She stopped. Paul shrugged his shoulders.
She spoke the words shortly and sharply. suggested the stunted woman at his
side. Steinmetz smiled grimly to himself. Your secret is safe with me. I will
see what I can do.
     Steinmetz shrugged his shoulders with a commiserating smile. said the
countess sharply. Since I was here, answered Steinmetz. she said. Were there any
in St. she said. Steinmetz shrugged his shoulders with a heart-whole laugh.
There was a sudden sympathy between these two, and sudden sympathies are the
best. she said. I wanted to speak to you, she said. He was steering with
infinite skill. Since you will be there? Paul shrugged his shoulders. I am
sorry, he said. Speaking as a sportsman. From all and sundry. Between now and
seven o'clock. No more than she has been sending. It will suffice for my small
wants. We are only the sowers. And who sold them? Good-evening, she said.
Steinmetz glanced sharply down at her. she said. He shrugged his great
shoulders. Well, said Steinmetz, and what of St. I did not suspect you of having
them. What do you suspect her of? Stop her! No; he is only in Siberia.
     she said. I am sorry for that, she said. It would seem that she had
something more to say. Such never sleep, she said. It was a singular scene. No,
said Paul sharply, I don't. We shall see. Paul shrugged his shoulders. They
stood side by side. She was staring into the fire--staring--staring. It is our
secret surgery and office. But he did not sit down. Shall we say eleven o'clock?
It was stone-like now, and set. And now he is in Siberia. Etta shrugged her
shoulders. I suppose it is the snow. she said. She smiled. Etta shrugged her
shoulders. What statements? There was a smell of pine-wood and soap. It was like
a silent scene on a stage. And still there was no sound. It was still singularly
like a scene on the stage. What had they seen? The starosta spread out his
hands. They will not speak to me. I am suspected. It is half-past seven.
     Steinmetz shrugged his broad shoulders. There is no sentiment in
starvation. No; I have not seen him. And what did she say? He is still at it.
Stop! he shouted. It was so unlike her and so sudden that Steinmetz was
startled. He has seen you all. Sit down! There was a sullen silence. Are you
sure of that? I have seen to that. Is this a sample of it? She was stony and
stubborn. Sydney Bamborough, said Steinmetz slowly. Now I will not spare you.
Tell me the story, he said. I shall see through it. he said slowly. Are you sure
of it? Steinmetz advised me to speak to you. You are strong. No; they suspected
me. You cannot do it, he said. There was a suggestion of spring in the air. It
seems so to me, undoubtedly, he said. I am sure of it, he said. And she
shivered. They have no ladders, Steinmetz and I have seen to that.
     When the German spoke he had to shout. they were shrieking. We can make a
stand at the head of the stairs, then the door-way, then---- He shrugged his
shoulders. Did they shoot at you? he shouted to Steinmetz. I am sure she did
that. She smiled at him sadly through her tears. Will you sit here where I was
sitting? Then she sat down. You cannot see it. He is staying with me here. From
our exile we still sow our seed. said Steinmetz, and no other word was spoken.
Steinmetz shook his shaggy head. He shrugged his shoulders and shivered. It has
a saddle, said Steinmetz at length. This man, he said, was starving. Steinmetz
stooped down. I don't see how they can stop us, he said. The Seine and the
Thames--shallow--shallow--shallow. That is to say, he was a sort of social
revolver. I did not expect to see you here, she said. She was of that school.
Then she suppressed a sigh--badly. The baron shrugged his shoulders. Will you
not sit down? He was surprised at his own sincerity. she asked, still smiling.
She shrugged her shoulders and waited. Good-night, he said shortly.
     There was a short silence. He believes it still, which is somewhat
startling. See you later, he said. But he did not say it. I am not very sure
that it will be a success. She did not speak at once. she said. said the
starosta. You see something on the road? The starosta, standing in his door-way,
saw the smile. The sound was repeated, and Steinmetz slowly rose from his seat.
It is slow. Paul shrugged his shoulders. The starosta struck a light. Paul
shrugged his shoulders. Because she loves you, he said shortly. I will send it
off, he said. Quite suddenly she stopped. The sun had just set. asked Steinmetz
sharply. She shrugged her shoulders. Steinmetz shook his head. she said.
exclaimed Steinmetz, spluttering. she said. She stopped. Paul shrugged his
shoulders. She spoke the words shortly and sharply. suggested the stunted woman
at his side. Steinmetz smiled grimly to himself.
     Your secret is safe with me. I will see what I can do. Steinmetz shrugged
his shoulders with a commiserating smile. said the countess sharply. Since I was
here, answered Steinmetz. she said. Were there any in St. she said. Steinmetz
shrugged his shoulders with a heart-whole laugh. There was a sudden sympathy
between these two, and sudden sympathies are the best. she said. I wanted to
speak to you, she said. He was steering with infinite skill. Since you will be
there? Paul shrugged his shoulders. I am sorry, he said. Speaking as a
sportsman. From all and sundry. Between now and seven o'clock. No more than she
has been sending. It will suffice for my small wants. We are only the sowers.
And who sold them? Good-evening, she said. Steinmetz glanced sharply down at
her. she said. He shrugged his great shoulders. Well, said Steinmetz, and what
of St. I did not suspect you of having them. What do you suspect her of?
     Stop her! No; he is only in Siberia. she said. I am sorry for that, she
said. It would seem that she had something more to say. Such never sleep, she
said. It was a singular scene. No, said Paul sharply, I don't. We shall see.
Paul shrugged his shoulders. They stood side by side. She was staring into the
fire--staring--staring. It is our secret surgery and office. But he did not sit
down. Shall we say eleven o'clock? It was stone-like now, and set. And now he is
in Siberia. Etta shrugged her shoulders. I suppose it is the snow. she said.
Etta shrugged her shoulders. She smiled. Etta shrugged her shoulders. What
statements? There was a smell of pine-wood and soap. It was like a silent scene
on a stage. And still there was no sound. It was still singularly like a scene
on the stage. What had they seen? The starosta spread out his hands.
     They will not speak to me. I am suspected. It is half-past seven.
Steinmetz shrugged his broad shoulders. There is no sentiment in starvation. No;
I have not seen him. And what did she say? He is still at it. Stop! he shouted.
It was so unlike her and so sudden that Steinmetz was startled. He has seen you
all. Sit down! There was a sullen silence. Are you sure of that? Is that you,
Steinmetz? I have seen to that. Is this a sample of it? She was stony and
stubborn. Sydney Bamborough, said Steinmetz slowly. Now I will not spare you.
Tell me the story, he said. I shall see through it. Are you sure of it? Etta
shrugged her shoulders. Steinmetz advised me to speak to you. You are strong.
No; they suspected me. You cannot do it, he said. There was a suggestion of
spring in the air.
     It seems so to me, undoubtedly, he said. I am sure of it, he said. And she
shivered. They have no ladders, Steinmetz and I have seen to that. When the
German spoke he had to shout. they were shrieking. We can make a stand at the
head of the stairs, then the door-way, then---- He shrugged his shoulders. Did
they shoot at you? he shouted to Steinmetz. said Steinmetz breathlessly. I am
sure she did that. She smiled at him sadly through her tears. Will you sit here
where I was sitting? Then she sat down. You cannot see it. He is staying with me
here. From our exile we still sow our seed. said Steinmetz, and no other word
was spoken. It has been said that a G.O.C. And there were spies. The Scots were

it was a mistake to sympathize with the South. Results of Silver Stock. They
seized her. His structure is significant. of the Shak. Stop! Should he snap?
--and he shuddered. said his master softly. Don't stop! The scene shifted. He
sprang to his feet, his spine stiffening and a snarl in his throat. I hadn't
thought before--but it's strange, he said. It was his spirit. She did not speak
to him. The shadows were still fighting. She was very still.
     he shouted again. The sky was filled with stars. Something happened very
soon after that. What shall it be? He stared straight into the flames. she said.
But she was very still. Then all was still. She was still there. It'll seem
mighty strange. I see that by the snow. They met shoulder to shoulder. She fell
on her side, snapping and snarling. The sky was a blaze of stars. It shivered in
the tree-tops above her. He, too, scented it now. He snarled at the still air.
They still bore signs of the sledge-traces. He snarled. It was the season of
slaughter and not of hunger. On both sides of the stream they swarmed into the
near-by timber. Astounded, they stood while he stared. They swam swiftly from
shore to shore, paying no attention to the dead-line now. But this was summer.
He started south--up the McFarlane. They had stood side by side. Scent had
followed swiftly. With a snarl he leaped at Sandy. It smashed against his
shoulder, and sent him down in the sand. said the other.
     It was he who had spoken. Make it six, he said. The smell of Kazan was
strong about her. Jean-Pierre Severin se tut. What a fine, silver-hilted Spanish
sword! Sometimes on Sundays, when the Rev. To be sure, to be sure! Stop! Stop!
Very well, said Barnaby; I have it here safe and sound, and you shall see it.
said the other. And did you catch the Spanish ship? Sir, said Dunburne, very
seriously, I am sorry that I am not more to your mind. What a fine, silver-
hilted Spanish sword! Sometimes on Sundays, when the Rev. To be sure, to be

Dunburne, very seriously, I am sorry that I am not more to your mind. Stop this!
Saffron's. The General shrugged his shoulders. I should be shy, said the
Sergeant, grinning. And you're sure of 'Eaven? here you are, sir? Mr. Saffron
spoke with a sudden sharpness, in pointed rebuke. Mr. Saffron smiled pensively.
     They shall be, sir, depend on it. Who can be surprised at it? He smiled
again. I'm sorry! Mr. Saffron has sent for me--professionally. I shall be there
almost as soon as he is. He smiled. Still, there it is. I see that. The words
sounded scornful; they were spoken for the Sergeant as well as for himself. said
the stranger politely. There is from Sprotsfield. The Sergeant smiled. Don't
speak. I can see from here. But hasn't your son said anything? Then, with a
sudden smile, she amended, No, I shouldn't! he said, starting to walk on again.
Then he smiled slowly, as it were tentatively. That's all there is about it, I
suppose, she said in a scornful sadness. I'm sorry too, very sorry, that it
should have to be good-bye between us. He stood quite still. She sat up. It came
to me, somehow, in my sleep. Something in that subconsciousness theory? I
suppose 'Morocco' put you on the scent? He is secretive? She waited, now with a
sudden sense of suspense. Yes, sir, said the Sergeant, grinning still. Just
match-boarding, the Sergeant says it is, does he?
     The Sergeant shivered a little. They'll shut me up! I dare say I've
sounded very self-righteous. Then they stole softly nearer to it. But that was
sentiment. Yet he stood where he was, smoking still. He shrugged his shoulders.
If you stir or speak, I'll strangle you! Seeing what she saw now, she stood
still in surprise. And you, Sergeant, remember what I said! You stay here. But
the Sergeant himself? Was there somebody there--and the Sergeant in league with
him? There, too, no Sergeant and no sack! The Sergeant? Stand up and listen to
me, Sergeant, he said. But I'm suggesting now--as you did before--that we should
be partners--in a secret, in Mr. Saffron's secret. My sack, the sack I rescued?
No, no, how stupid you are! Do you say it's--it's supposed to be there? Silly!
That's to say, not in itself particularly surprising. He smiled. He seemed to be
in the highest spirits. I'm sorry; for them, upon my soul I am! he said sternly.
The supplies will be safe, then. That settles it, then. You do, to start with.
And now they've stolen it!
     Say, did you see them then? Jerry only smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
Sartin I will. I'll show ye all about it by signs. There was a snap. I sartin
will, and soon at that. You didn't see any signs of the gun while there, did
you? They all saw it now. Suppose you state your reasons then. I was just
sitting here when I heard a step. Why, you're shivering now. Sorry to say we
haven't, Mr. Smithson. Why, to be sure we will. There, see that! But still it
has happened, you see. he shouted. Speak to me about that, will you? They seem
to be carrying something between them. That sort of thing is too one-sided to
suit me. They started a search immediately. sang out Will just then. Sometimes
surprises spring out of the very earth. A swanker to the finger-tips. That
settled, they sat down to dinner. Very, I should say. This is strange, Morriston
said. His sister gave a shrug. Can you see this gentleman, sir? What are we to
say to him? Sorry?
     But we shall see. Did the doctor say suicide? Will you see for yourself,
sir? Well, we shall see. The idea is simply staggering. Shall we see him? But we
are at your service. Is he sure of it? Where he was a stranger? I shall, his
sister replied. Well, we shall see. And one can scarcely be surprised. Thank
you, he said simply. He is still about here. What is it, Stent? Could I speak to
you, sir? She shrugged. I will see these gentlemen at once, he said. For my
sake, or yours? I have something to say to you. If only I had not been in that
suspicious brown suit! I am sure of that, as I am sure of you, she replied. If
you can do that-- she said. I am sure of that from something he once let slip.
Now what I have to say to you is this. I simply state the position. There is no
more to be said. Very well, she said, if that will satisfy you. That is
understood, she said with a smile. Stories of the Seen and the Unseen.
     We will soon put a stop to that. Surely, I said. How silly it was, after
all! For God's sake, what is it, sir? As sane as--I--or you. That's science!
It's not science,--it's common-sense, said the Doctor. The scoffer could scoff
no more. And then I saw what he had said. It doesn't suit my state of mind. I
allow it is very strange, very strange. I cannot see through it. And she had no
successor. and to whom am I to speak? Of course I shall speak to him at once.
She seemed very poor, said I. she said. I sprang to my feet, and then I sat down
again. And what do you say to me? That is always something, I suppose.
Something! What I said was, What am I to do? He stopped himself. Something that
is stronger than I has brought me. It seems, sir, that I have said everything.
shouted still another. You are the son of my sister Sophia. Shoot him! You are
correct, said Smith, for he it was. Yes, said Simpson, I know you now; you are a
spying scoundrel.


TANGO

     Toady! Do tell her that! What do you think of that? Now what do you think?
Thank you; I think I have. Be you a teacher? You shall tell me by and by when we
are in town. 'If I don't take you there, what will you do?' Please take these
things. I thank you, and tell you what you will. Thanks, thanks! Will you own
the truth? He has told you, then? Was it true? I thought so then. Think so?
Tacitus is more tiresome than Cicero. What are you talking about? Tell him what
you tried on shore. I'll be a thousand times obliged! Have you tried to treat
this tooth yourself, in any way? I'll take this all out of him before I'm
through with him! And you think you're It? Is it, though? Thus the time passed
on. No trouble about that. Touge. What are you thinking of? Are you in any
trouble here? Why don't you tell me?
     Are you trying to pick trouble with me? Treadwell can thump me. Only two.
I tremble in thinking! His time is his own. You thieves! If she didn't feel so,
she'd have told you the thing. The two talked with ever-growing interest. Thine,
John--Thine. There rose a titter about the two. Don't you think so? But you I'll
take; and you'd do well to think it over. What is she trying to do? What was you
tryin' to do? You thieves! Then take this thing away. And I--thank you. Why
didn't you tell me not to do those things? Tell you not to do things that you
had thought out for yourself and decided on? You should have told me. The very
thought of it terrified her. It was half-past ten. This is what's been troubling
you, is it? They taught me more things than talk. Once or twice they were
delayed to talk. Thus they rounded the turn. These things tripped me up. She
told herself that it was the only thing to do. We'll have those things off of
him in no time, he shouted. They just had to trust me.
     She toed in. Twenty-one, I thought. What do you think I have to tell you?
They were all teasing me about you. Teasing her about him, were they? You think
that? She was tense. He turned. She therefore talked with him about himself. You
two are tied as tight as the church could tie you. They told. The only trouble
is, she will not take the time. I think we just will. They're so--so-- You
haven't had but two, have you? So he told me. Why did he tell you at all, then?
What did you think it was? But if we don't tell, what'll they think then? He
told me. He told you! It was terrible for him to have to do. He did tell me the
truth! Where had she gone, with whom had she talked, what had she told? What do
I think of him? How should I tell? That's the ticket! She had not thought of
that. It's true. I've told her so. Why didn't you tell them you're not?
     Why, tell them we're both twenty-one. Is that all you can think of? I'm
too tired. He had, he said, told her this thirty-seven times. It's true. That's
the truth. I'm talked about now! But I didn't think-- You didn't think what?
With Reminiscences of the Trotting Turf. I told them all about it. and
Terpsichore. From the Tombs. Why is not all that taken? Why not tax that? And
why should not these things be? I think so. Toof! toof! He is a teacher.
Therefore all things are immortal. At two o'clock we left Troy. tons. Trond.
Then the tide turned. I will try to tell you about it. 'War is terrible! It is
torture even to think of them. Have you told her of the thing which terrifies
you? What do you think of me? Therefore, I am Truly Happy.
     Threateningly, he came towards me. Just in time. she thought. I should
think. It was too true! tons. Trond. Then the tide turned. I will try to tell
you about it. 'War is terrible! It is torture even to think of them. Their faith
was tried and true. But I'll tell you what I'll do. I then threw myself at her
feet and thanked her. Tell me all that has happened to thee. This is not Troy,
about, above-- Not Troy, nor we the lords thereof. How say'st thou? And thou,
what tears can tell thy doom? 'Tis not in joy I tell thee. When wast thou taken?
They were great things to thee!. This is not Troy, about, above-- Not Troy, nor
we the lords thereof. How say'st thou? And thou, what tears can tell thy doom?
'Tis not in joy I tell thee. When wast thou taken? They were great things to
thee!. I thank you. Treason! Truly my brothers will be thankful to thee for thy
money.
     or Go thou, Thomas! Now, Tanner, it is thy turn. Now I believe that what
thou tellest is no true tale. Thwack! thwack! After thee, lad, after thee. Is it
thus, thou traitor knave! Is it not thus? Take that, then! But tell me truly,
what hast thou in thy pouches? Who art thou that talkest so? Is this true?
Thinkest thou so? That was true. It was true. He's not a tribesman. Don't take
me there! I'll take you up on that. We'll tie it up here and now. Where you been
all this time? Didn't have time to talk long with him. Think because you're C.N.
It'll be thisaway. I'll turn 'em over to you. Told me to tell you so, Tom
answered. How're tricks? You're through bull-whackin', Tom. You try that, C.N.
That's true. Then we hit the trail together, you-all an' me.
     Not to-day, thank you. Don't touch me. It was true. But I don't think it.
He told you? Where was he taking her? Where are you taking me? It's true what I
told you once. It's the truth. You're travelin' with me now. You're tired.
You'll not touch her. Emergencies had tested them time and again. Take his
snowshoes and the team. Now he took plenty of time. But we were in time. Or two
more. What was he thinking? We'll team together fine. A turn in the trail hid
her. The timber was not thick. Don't you think? She told him. You trot along and
I'll tag. We don't know what a tough time he's been through. Too tight. Not a
thing. It was a tradition. Again he fired--twice--three times. He's a go-getter,
Tom is.
     He hadn't a thing to do with it, had he? Don't thank me. But we're talking
about Tom now. he teased. What do you think? And I try to be. He's one out of
ten thousand. Why didn't you tell me-- Tell you what? Why, just think of it!
Then he lost the thread of his thought. There, there--I told you. How touching!
I've been talking to some of them. Now, what do you think of that? I'm not at
all tired. I can try. What have we to tell him? Will you, though? I don't think
I ought to take these. I hadn't thought of that. I hadn't thought of that. He is
from my town. It was twelve o'clock and after. What are you doing here, Tarpey?
Why hadn't he thought of this before? There were three--tied to the peach-trees.
Think of it! It is true. I don't think it. it can not be true.
     Traitor! Thank you. Where does she think he is? Oh, why didn't he tell me
this at the time? I think it is typhoid fever. Think I should. Thank you. A lie
is truth to those who only tell the truth. Can you take me there now? I think he
did. It was true. If I thought so, though I should have been mistaken, I told a
moral truth.' We talked of Letter-writing. Think of it.' 'Why no, Sir; not the
same: it is a tale told. Think for me what I can do. Thought is better than no
thought.' Thus, in No. Here a translation. All this is what Twalmley did. I took
leave of Mrs. Thrale. No, a tragedy. It was in Mr. Thrale's life-time. He at
times treated her harshly. Dr. Taylor. 'Tully's Tusculan Questions, a
translation of them. 'Coluthus, to be translated. Because you been trailing him
two thousand miles. We had trouble. Not a thing.
     No matter where the trail takes you? Think! And thank you. Tush! He
turned. When she thought of superlatives, she thought of him. Try it. One of two
things. It was a type of the gold-rush town. No tramps in here. I'll take you to
her. Does he think I have time for letters? Not tonight. And he turned to the
three. And before midafternoon he had thought of a thing to do. So she tried
different tactics. Two of them. Will you try it? His tongue tremblingly
moistened them. I didn't think of you. Tush, then I need not have taken my trip.
But, oh, I thought you had a touch of the other thing! Two days, I think. Uncle
Toby took me in. And-- Don't tell me any more. A thousand times no! We still
have some things to talk over. A thousand times more! Tears? Donnegan, tell me
the trick of it?
     He has told you what? Did you tell her that? Are you talking to me? You
think you have me down? I think so. I'm in terrible, terrible trouble! What are
you trying to do to me? He was thoughtful. But if they fail this time they'll
try again. It's ten o'clock! Is what true? It's all true, then? You're a
thousand times welcome to her. I have more to say: I have a thousand things! Do
you think I could trust you? No, I just been thinking. It's the time! Take it
then! Because you been trailing him two thousand miles. We had trouble. Not a
thing. No matter where the trail takes you? Think! And thank you. He turned.
When she thought of superlatives, she thought of him. Try it. One of two things.

don't tell, what'll they think then? He told me. He told you!
     It was terrible for him to have to do. He did tell me the truth! Where had
she gone, with whom had she talked, what had she told? What do I think of him?
How should I tell? That's the ticket! She had not thought of that. It's true.
Why didn't you tell them you're not? Why, tell them we're both twenty-one. Is
that all you can think of? I'm too tired. He had, he said, told her this thirty-
seven times. It's true. That's the truth. I'm talked about now! But I didn't
think-- You didn't think what? Why, then, do you tell of it? Tracts of thousands
and tens of thousands, are sometimes not to be discovered. We'll talk about it,
another time. I think not. That is true. Tould! I have thought of all. But, no
such thing. I think not. I think not. What think you of all this? I thought,
howsever, that they was most non-plussed, when I told 'em of the field-piece.
Ten, twenty, t'ree spot--s'pose him tree?
     This soon told on trail. Tell all about him. I think it will turn out so,
Joyce. Why Cap'in touch him? Tell yours truly all about it. Have you told him
about it? Why, it's the very thing! What have you and Teddy been doing now?
Isn't it train time yet? We thought you weren't on the train. Oh, thieves and
things. Tell you what? Only it will take time. Think! Thanks. An all-day trip is
pretty tiresome. Over there through the trees! And there be some times that I
don't blame 'em for what they thinks. I told them to bring in the things. Wh-
what time is it? I shouldn't think you'd be talking of ghosts any more. I tell
you what! I thought so then. But who thought of it? One--two--three! Now what do
you think of that? On a tire. What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
What a tale their terror tells Of Despair! is it thou?
     'Tis time. Think of eternal things! Be thyself! It is most true-- All this
is very true. Now this is true-- All very true. What are you talking of? is it
thy will On the breezes to toss? But this thing was not to be. Tell me of it.
I'll try! You--taught me how! He--he let me trip him up and throw him! Which of
you takes the trail? After that there was no more talk. You must be tolerable
tired. What in thunder is it all about? I'll tell you what that uncle of yours
was-- Don't talk! I been thinking things out. There's three things in the world.
Just three things and no more. You think so? He don't think about those things.
That's what you think. Here's your ten. It's just a trick. D'you think you can
do the same? And keep talking to him all the time. Don't try him again. What do
you think? What you been thinking about?
     Take him with me? Tell me that? But I been thinking. Trust her for that.
Will you take them? Thank you. Now thin, said Terrence. Just the thing for me!
Two or three miles. But, Terrence, what are we to do? He is at the tavern. Where
are we, Terrence? over with that thing! I thought so. Terrence, are you telling
me the truth? he thought. In the tavern. Little Tippy Toes. Little Tippy Toes.
asked Tippy Toes. asked Tippy Toes. He looked at Tippy Toes. He stared at Tippy
Toes. Tippy Toes said, What is that? what fine things he took out! Just think!
During all that time their strength had been turned against themselves. It was
not till B.C. At Tarsus, in B.C. The touch of a torpedo numbness?
     O golden thoughts and true! Thou art the thief! I think not; at least--I
cannot tell. Not all, I think. Were we transformed? Is the taboo of a thousand
valid? I've told him all I know and now it's your turn. You were not taken in
that time, I do believe. Do you have it all the time? You call them to tea when
I tell you. But how can I tell? Or was it some other time? You are thinking of
things before the time. I didn't think of that? I think it is. Why don't you
talk to me? thank you! We are in the world where the temptations are; what
temptations do you have? You haven't told me why you were there. How about the
tumble down now? Two will do until next time. I didn't think of that. But it is
good-bye this time. I think not. What a treat you will have! Can't you think and
tell me? I'll tell you by and by. And I trusted him so! Was it to take tea? We
all did it together.
     She thinks it does. Didn't you have all the things we have? I'll tell you
one, though. And, after that, we talked till midnight. I have no time for sight-
seeing. Tradition. She is my talisman. I just thought of it. But he threw you
off. You have told me all? I have not told you all--he thinks we are married. He
did tell me that! Repeat it three times. It isn't tempting. What is it that
tires you so to-night? What do you think? I've plenty of time for thinking! I
think so. Twenty, I think. Who told you? It is all true. Then don't tell her. Is
that true? She has told me. I think you do. I never thought about those things.
I think you care only for such things. I had not thought of it. I should think
his trouble was about Will, if I hadn't the letter. Was it her trouble?
     I was thinking of your time. I tried to be. Don't you think it is about
time? But I never thought of such a thing. I can tell you about it now. It will
take time. But if you think it is because-- I do think so. How can she care, if
she thinks I have trifled with her? All you have to do is to tell her what you
have told me. She will throw you off. You were in trouble, weren't you? It is
not a temptation to me. Of all things! Why do you think he will? Why should he
tell you that? I was talking about you. Troubled about what? What will they all
think? I thought I was to tell you. I just thought of it. I've told him all I
know and now it's your turn. You were not taken in that time, I do believe. Do
you have it all the time? You call them to tea when I tell you. But how can I
tell? Or was it some other time? You are thinking of things before the time.
Thank you, and good-bye. I didn't think of that? I think it is.
     Why don't you talk to me? thank you! We are in the world where the
temptations are; what temptations do you have? You haven't told me why you were
there. How about the tumble down now? I didn't think of that. But it is good-bye
this time. I think not. What a treat you will have! Can't you think and tell me?
I'll tell you by and by. And I trusted him so! Was it to take tea? We all did it
together. She thinks it does. Didn't you have all the things we have? I'll tell
you one, though. And, after that, we talked till midnight. I have no time for
sight-seeing. Tradition. She is my talisman. I just thought of it. But he threw
you off. You have told me all? I have not told you all--he thinks we are

     I've plenty of time for thinking! I think so. Twenty, I think. Who told

throw you off. You were in trouble, weren't you? It is not a temptation to me.
Of all things! Why do you think he will? Why should he tell you that?
     I was talking about you. Troubled about what? What will they all think? I
thought I was to tell you. I just thought of it. Then you turn back at Tver? We
have here a tragedy. Tell me about yourself. Thanks. No, thanks. Who can tell?
Take her out. I think so. It has been terrible. I think not. She was just over
the threshold. Thanks. Tell me--how is she? Tell me about him. Is that true?
Will you take me down? But I think you ought to try it. No; I am not tired. And
where is Thors? Then she turned to the writing-table. A Russian table d'hote is
therefore any thing but hilarious in its tendency. Then what are you doing in
Tver? And that thought had a thousand branches. I cannot tell what you are
thinking of. She told me so herself.
     I am very tired. He has told you! I thought you were clean and thrifty. I
tell no tales, and I take no money. Who has been telling you that? There will be
no taxes. I thought not. She had tried. This is such a time. We are no
tchinovniks. Tell me that! I tell them again now. I am tired of you. They both
turned. I think not. But I have tried to do so. I will try and do the right
thing by her. She was tired. I have tried to be just. Thanks. Do you think so?
Then he turned toward her. Then you turn back at Tver? We have here a tragedy.
Tell me about yourself. Thanks. No, thanks. Who can tell? Take her out. I think
so.
     It has been terrible. I think not. She was just over the threshold.
Thanks. Tell me--how is she? Tell me about him. Is that true? Will you take me
down? But I think you ought to try it. No; I am not tired. And where is Thors?
Then she turned to the writing-table. A Russian table d'hte is therefore any
thing but hilarious in its tendency. Then what are you doing in Tver? And that
thought had a thousand branches. I cannot tell what you are thinking of. She
told me so herself. I am very tired. He has told you! I thought you were clean
and thrifty. I tell no tales, and I take no money. Who has been telling you
that? There will be no taxes. I thought not. She had tried. This is such a time.
Tell me that! I tell them again now. I am tired of you. They both turned.
     I think not. But I have tried to do so. I will try and do the right thing
by her. She was tired. I have tried to be just. Thanks. Do you think so? Then he
turned toward her. I think so. They had to be tuned up and trained for a big
task. They were on their toes, as the cavalry told them. They had turned in.
Thus were the people terrorised. Tawil overlooks a track which has been trodden
from time immemorial. I think so. They had to be tuned up and trained for a big
task. They were on their toes, as the cavalry told them. They had turned in.
Thus were the people terrorised. Tawil overlooks a track which has been trodden
from time immemorial. S. Teverbaugh and H.I. 'Tis with thee. Didn't I tell you
he'd do it? I'm not at all thirsty. The blue-bottle has no tickle for him now.
In two senses this is not true. McCready turned to Thorpe. Thorpe was taking the
chain. Ho, Thorpe--Thorpe! Thorpe!
     Ho, Thorpe!--Thorpe! This time Thorpe replied. And now he had torn
McCready's throat. And now-- Thorpe had come out from the tent. It thrilled him
now. He had traveled all day, but he was not tired. The man was taking up their
trail. Pulling down the tent was a task. She exposed it for a time on the top of
the tent. He did not tell Henri all he thought. Twice he had won. Now--all
together! There was no time to turn. He turned. And twenty-five, and twenty-six,
and twenty-seven, and twenty-eight, and twenty-nine, and thirty. Can you tell me
that? Why, Tom--why, Tom Chist! And twenty-five, and twenty-six, and twenty-
seven, and twenty-eight, and twenty-nine, and thirty. Can you tell me that? Why,
Tom--why, Tom Chist! She's more tearful than you are yourself. That was the form
her thoughts took. You're tired? What do you think? I had thought of her. I
tried to. And a thousand thanks. What became of that thing after it was taken
into the Tower? There's no train up from here to-night. Then he turned off his
torch.
     I can tell you what I have to tell in a few minutes. It's time I was off,
too. he was thinking. You can be off tomorrow! But what are you two doing? I'm
tired, and I want to think. He turned it up. Tradition, and Mr. Penrose, had
told the truth. You're not fit to do that now--and no more am I, to tell the
truth. And so I was too--though not in the way he thought. Thousands? Thanks.
Now's our time, then! I thought so! He's in a very temper with you too. There's
nothing to tempt thieves, is there? In the thick of it--and enjoying it so
tremendously! Think you're the whole team, do you? Because if he has a line of
traps the morning is the time he tends them, I'm told. Take that, you pelt
thief, and that! Tell me about that, will you? Just try for yourselves. Do you
think so? Do you think Bluff can be in trouble? Now you come tearing up things.
Talk to me about that, will you? Then we can talk it over. That's the truth. he
said, after the tale was told. Just thinking so myself.


UNIFORM

     Do not be ungrateful to uncle or unjust to yourself. Your uncle will be
uneasy. It's all of us! This is ungrateful. what are they to us? Underclothing.
Underclothing. I have no use for them. And a money-gorging usurer? Now out upon
it! Now, out upon it! Now out upon it! Now, out upon it! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! It is not so with us. I don't understand you. Ugh! Unworthy!
Don't you have a uniform? Ugh! It was useless. He used to talk uncharitably.'
But it will not be understood.' What that was useful to her?
     Can you use it? We understand each other? For once she was unguarded. I
underestimated you. Unfortunately not. Not us! Not us. What that was useful to
her? Can you use it? For once she was unguarded. I underestimated you.
Unfortunately not. Not us! Not us. It's all of us! Uneasiness about what? You
have not understood me! Ugh! At us. Unannounced. Unapproachable! Unrivalled,
unhappy! They were so utterly unconscious of what she was going through. But I
am so contradictory, so unsatisfied and so unsatisfying. He had understood then,
he should understand now. What will unsettle me? What unsettled you now? They
were so utterly unconscious of what she was going through. But I am so
contradictory, so unsatisfied and so unsatisfying. He had understood then, he
should understand now.


VICTOR

     These are all visible, and their fluctuations are visible. Victory!
Victory! Victory! He was not the only victim. Do tell me who you are visiting--
or are you visiting here? The Victory! It was too vast for her. Down with the
villains! Don't be too venturesome. 'Henry V' now. Vincent is down there now.
Can I, Vincent? It was too vast for her. --Victor, Victor, depeche-toi! There is
--what voice was that? At the Vatican. And now again all was void. Victory is
ours! Their velocity. Who, the valet? Visited? Vocabulary! That will not be this
voyage. Visited? Vocabulary! That will not be this voyage. The Volga! The Volga!
They, too, were veterans.


WHISKEY

     I've been working and waiting, she began. 'Guess it won't!' That was my
wife. Then you went to find your wife? When is the wedding to be? she whispered
eagerly, as they went up-stairs. But it is well. I wonder if he has any of his
own. Didn't I do that well? The world is more just. This way! No--not for
worlds! Whew, but I wish I had been there! Are they both well? So it went on;
Welsh, Welsh, Welsh, nothing but Welsh, until I was heartily sick of it. But
where am I wandering? She had not wanted them. She wanted this. The buttons wore
well. That's the way. That's what she would. The water! How do they work? I'm
willin' to have you. She walks mighty well. You won't have to. There isn't any
other way for me. In what way? Development isn't what a woman wants. What do you
want of her?
     You wanted me to, didn't you? Whar's she at? I wish't she would! Laurelly,
she won't work. What is it you want of me? I would--I would marry her. She won't
have to. No, she whispered. If you won't, I won't. Don't worry about me. Well,
don't worry. Don't worry about me. She was very weary. Whar am I at? Well--what
is it? Now, which way? I don't know whar it went. Well, but, Herbert-- It was
his wife again. Well now. Nor did she watch wistfully. For there in Warbleton
these words are not commonplace. Well then, what are you doing here? Well, I
ought to work. You want it, too. Don't you want to? Would you? And there don't
have to be witnesses . Why not all walk down? I don't want any more. Very well,
then.
     Didn't he write to you? Not a word. Well, but he's here with you, isn't
he? He would have. Well, I wish you'd give it to me. I want it. Won't you please
write it down for me? Well, what are you doing here? He's West. She went to the
post-office. I will write to him about it. Write to him now! And I want you
should write him now. And it was too warm. I was there for a week. Wouldn't that
be. Well, say! You would! And I do their work. The whole town's wondering. Went
off! Down the walk. I wish she wouldn't do that without telling me. She went
that way, she said. Well, he's here. This is wrong--it is wrong. What would you
have me do? Well, where have you, been? You were with her--where in the world
had you been? Why, I wouldn't have it told for worlds. Because he wanted me.
     You won't! I don't want it. Very well. All this is wrong. that we should
write it. Weak as Water. He wrote a will of his own. Whew! Odds, writs and
warrants! Odds, writs and warrants! She was remembered as she would have wished
to be. White. This is war. 'Where are you wounded?' I expressed to him my wonder
at the few wounded. The wounded! Then we went west, while they went east. The
bullets went wide. Wounded. They have been growing worse and worse. I want to
have a talk with you about my wife. Then you are not well? The wardrobe is built
into the wall. That woman is now a widow. I did it in this way. What is your
work? of his works? The writing of No. Here, take it and treasure it, for I do
not want it, the wicked, wicked woman! You are both in the wrong.
     the Wandle. No, worse than that. the Wandle. No, worse than that. I've
been out here a week now. This is war. 'Where are you wounded?' I expressed to
him my wonder at the few wounded. The wounded! Then we went west, while they
went east. The bullets went wide. Wounded. Then she would be whipped, and he
would make her whip all of the gang. So the work went on until all was reeled.
It was then whitewashed. I wonder what she wants now. Then I went into the
woods. So I obeyed without a word. This is why we were so wet. Have you any
whisky? I am not in want of the riches of this world. what words are these! I
went up to him and said, 'is all well?' O Women of Troy, weep for me! Wherefore?
And is this not woe? The wickedness! Weep for him ne'er so well, Thy weeping
shall not wake him. Out, woman! All is well.
     O Women of Troy, weep for me! Wherefore? And is this not woe? The
wickedness! Weep for him ne'er so well, Thy weeping shall not wake him. Out,
woman! All is well. Wat! Wat! Wat? Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat?
Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Wat! Now welcome! So they wended their way through the
forest. for more than three winks, I wot. Now, welcome! What is it Your Worship
would have me do?
     Why would she do that? You're to whip me. Then that's the way it'll be. So
it would be. Don't you worry about that. West did not want that. He was wounded.
He watched, warily. That's up to West. Just what would I be doing? An' what do
they want? She won't be a witness against us. Why won't she? I want her alive
an' not wounded. I don't want them. He would. I'm guessing West and Whaley. Is
this what he wants? What do you want? What do you want? Is your wife worse? He's
lookin' for a woman, not a wife. Don't worry. Not Whaley. Watch him. You're
Bully West's woman, un'erstand? He wanted her. Whaley was an expert woodsman.
Any one would 'a' been now, wouldn't they? It's West and Mr. Whaley.
     Is a' well wi' you, lass? Mr. Whaley was there the whole time. He went and
hid in the woods. Yon West's a wolf. Wouldn't say a word. He's makin' for the
whaling waters. So would I. What's wrong with him? Whajamean for me? You
wouldn't do that. He waited. It worried him. It's in the Word. We'll wait for
him here. He's a wonder, that other. Wasn't it because you wanted him to? I
wonder why. What do you want? You are worse! I wonder if they found Wesley? How
will you work it? I warrant you. Why, he would be in school, if there were no
war. But all is well. Wesley had no watch. He had no weapon. You are wounded.
You wrong them there. Work straight out under your window. You can work through
this wall with that.
     It is your wound. You won't have more'n a cat-nap. or can you wake? Very
well. Which of you wants water? I wonder who this can be? Whereto? No--that
would not do. Haven't they written? There is no other way. I wouldn't write
Olympia about it. Well, I'm willing now to be corrected. Do write to me. Why
should we walk there? 'And who is the worse for that?' 'But you did not write
against Warburton.' I wonder that women are not all Papists.' But this was not
the worst.' Will that word do?' Wooll's Warton, i. All this is well. You're all
wrong. And what do you want? But there is work. And the work? Not a word! It was
a thirty-two, a woman's light weapon. If you work for him you won't have him
over you. Not a word! Now what do you want?
     What is there to worry about? Watch yo'selves. Very well. By the way, what
did he want to see you about? She did not want him. He walked on. Why would you
do it? What is it you wish? Isn't there some way? Would it? Worse than I'm in?
he whispered. What's wrong? They are worthless. Well, it's this. I'll do all
that willingly--for you! I warrant you can do it! And I swear to you that I
won't weaken. Willingly. Your word! Your word! she whispered. Very well. I warn
you now. Now you whine at me. We don't want you out of the way. Who would it be?
And so she waited. It is I, she whispered. he whispered.
     What a merciless witch of a woman you are! We'll wait for them here. If
words would only come! Will you walk with me? You're all wrong. And what do you
want? But there is work. And the work? It was a thirty-two, a woman's light
weapon. If you work for him you won't have him over you. Not a word! Now what do
you want? What is there to worry about? Watch yo'selves. You were worried? But
it don't work. Very well. By the way, what did he want to see you about? She did
not want him. He walked on. Very well. Why would you do it? What is it you wish?
Isn't there some way? Would it? Worse than I'm in? he whispered. I'm not a
watchdog. What's wrong? They are worthless.
     Well, it's this. I'll do all that willingly--for you! I warrant you can do
it! And I swear to you that I won't weaken. Willingly. Your word! Your word! she
whispered. I warn you now. Now you whine at me. We don't want you out of the
way. Who would it be? And so she waited. It is I, she whispered. he whispered.
What a merciless witch of a woman you are! We'll wait for them here. If words
would only come! Will you walk with me? Well, but, Herbert-- It was his wife
again. Well now. Nor did she watch wistfully. For there in Warbleton these words
are not commonplace. Well then, what are you doing here? Well, I ought to work.
You want it, too. Don't you want to? Would you? And there don't have to be
witnesses . Why not all walk down?
     I don't want any more. Very well, then. Didn't he write to you? Well, but
he's here with you, isn't he? He would have. Well, I wish you'd give it to me. I
want it. Won't you please write it down for me? Well, what are you doing here?
He's West. She went to the post-office. I will write to him about it. Write to
him now! And I want you should write him now. And it was too warm. I was there
for a week. Wouldn't that be. Well, say! You would! And I do their work. The
whole town's wondering. Went off! Down the walk. I wish she wouldn't do that
without telling me. She went that way, she said. Well, he's here. This is wrong
--it is wrong. What would you have me do? Well, where have you, been? You were
with her--where in the world had you been? Very well.
     Why, I wouldn't have it told for worlds. Because he wanted me. You won't?
I don't want it. He not wanted. What want more? It is all-sufficient,
Willoughby. both are well. Woods. Mr. Woods! No wear red-coat. More than
t'ousand warrior! I wish it were well over. Mr. Woods, is it? Woods? You, Woods!
What can we do, Willoughby? Mr. Woods! He not wise! Willis. Why leave wigwam?--
Because wanted to. whispered the widowed mother. called out Willoughby, from a
window. Worse? I wonder what she wants. I wonder what's up. He will, won't he?
Isn't it wonderful! Why, they would walk right through him. she warned him.
     We'll wait and see if it works. I'm going for a walk in the woods. That's
the way! I wonder-- Well, why don't you open it? Sir William Willcocks. He's not
well! We'll have him at the wedding. We'll have him at the wedding. We'll have
him at the wedding. 'Tis well. Where am I?--'tis well--'tis very well! 'Merry
Wives of Windsor'. But just as if he'd waked up! It was a white world below him
and above. But would it wash over the top? Then why not the west window, fool!
This was in a whisper. No, he wouldn't. It's the wrist! But then he went on.
That's his way. Is this the way you want it? What would do you? When d'you want
to start work? But work? And he wondered why I didn't work the same way! No, and
I don't want to. Well, I kept at it that way. That's the way! What you want to
do now?
     But that's just what you want. Washington was wisely conservative. Now
what weapons do ye want? Weapons! No you won't. What am I wanted for? Well, I'm
for war! Winners wanted to speak with him. General, I am willing to do whatever
you wish. Are you wounded? Who is the wretch? He went to the well to draw water.
The wind whistled in his ears. Then whisk! The wind whistled in their ears as
they went. how wet they were! He went down the road calling, Woo, woo, woo! Then
whisk! Did Whiskers write the story? of our own winter. So the work went on. for
it is wearisome work to the arm. Which way is the wind now? Now w- wash
yourselves. I c-couldn't wish to be remembered in any p-pleasanter way. The
warning was well founded. So would you, if you were any other than you are. He
is a wizard. I wish I had them. Well, she assented, walking on.
     I want to. Will you write to me? Would her work be worth more to the
world? It would have been without him. It is wonderful. Have you written to him?
How wrong? No, it won't; I wouldn't understand a word. Because I didn't want to
be overshadowed; I wanted a welcome all my own. I have--and she has written.
Would I? Would you? I want you to be. How would that do? Whew! Linnet wrote that
it was your work. won't that do? But the moonlight on the water was most
wonderful of all! I will write to-night. I chose my wife, as she did her wedding
gown, for qualities that would wear well. Don't you know whether you are willing
or not? Will you write to me again? Didn't you want him to? I should have
written to-day. I wish I had them. Well, she assented, walking on. I want to.
Will you write to me? Would her work be worth more to the world? It would have
been without him.
     It is wonderful. Have you written to him? How wrong? No, it won't; I
wouldn't understand a word. Because I didn't want to be overshadowed; I wanted a
welcome all my own. I have--and she has written. Would I? Would you? I want you
to be. How would that do? Whew! Linnet wrote that it was your work. I did want
to so. won't that do? But the moonlight on the water was most wonderful of all!
I will write to-night. I chose my wife, as she did her wedding gown, for
qualities that would wear well. Don't you know whether you are willing or not?
Will you write to me again? Didn't you want him to? I should have written to-
day. No, she went on, I won't say that. Is that really all you want in this
world? Now, I wonder why? So, it is well. why won't he write to me? she
whispered. Then she walked on. It is well. I wonder why.
     I wonder why. I do not want to do that. His wife. We do not want him
there. And he went on writing. A woman. She went west with the papers. What do
you want me to do? Then what do you want? I am watched. But the winter is over
now. I want you, he went on, to assist me. And what do you wish me to do? she
whispered. Without these, what was she? It is worse than that. Where is the
wire? she was wondering. You are all welcome. I have been watching you. It is
well! It is well! Your wife! She wondered whether he would kill her. she
whispered. He went on in his blindness, went on being only just. I am your wife.
You have other work to do. You wish it? were the written words.
     No, she went on, I won't say that. Is that really all you want in this
world? Now, I wonder why? So, it is well. why won't he write to me? she
whispered. Then she walked on. It is well. I wonder why. I wonder why. I do not
want to do that. His wife. We do not want him there. And he went on writing. She
went west with the papers. What do you want me to do? What do you want? Then
what do you want? I am watched. But the winter is over now. I want you, he went
on, to assist me. And what do you wish me to do? What do you want me to do? she
whispered. Without these, what was she? It is worse than that. Where is the
wire? she was wondering. You are all welcome. I have been watching you.
     It is well! It is well! Your wife! She wondered whether he would kill her.
she whispered. He went on in his blindness, went on being only just. You have
other work to do. You wish it? were the written words. What do you want? They
were weatherwise. Whitehill. They were weatherwise. Whitehill. Ward, Charles J.
Williams. Winslow. H. Williams, J.C.A. They were wholly indifferent as to each
other's welfare. Wright, O.G. Ward, A.J. Well, he wanted to know, now! Well, he
wanted to know, now! Wolff, Mr. Raymond M. Weaver, and Dr. H.E. she whispered.
He's a wolf. Don't wake up your wife! But it was a wolf. Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!
     she went on. And Gray Wolf whined. Then she would wait for him. His only
weapon was a pocket-knife. It's not a wolf. And the other is--wolf. it's not a
wolf! Then he whined. That was the way of the wolf and the wolf-dog. There were
no wolves. Most of the beavers were now working in the water. He won't have his
weight before then. Then he went on. What wickedness is there in that? What
wickedness is there in that? Oh, well, she wrote to you about all that. Walford?
I've warned you. Those were his very words! What do they want to do it for?
Whose money would it be? Well, what of it? That went well, Hector! But no
whisky. I wouldn't have offended you for the world. No, I won't--and I wish you
wouldn't, Neddy. Because that's what you want. Now to our work! he whispered. he
whispered.
     he whispered. What would he do then? well, have it your own way. Well,
what? Whew! Whew! But what in the wide world is he doing? And the worst of it is

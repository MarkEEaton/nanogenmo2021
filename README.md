# A nonsensical abécédaire

This "novel" is a series of 26 prose-poems, each themed around a letter of the alphabet.

The text itself is drawn from Project Gutenberg, and is manipulated with NLTK and Python. It was coded in a few days in June 2021, mostly because I am always way too busy in November to do Nanogenmo then.
